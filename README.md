Title: "Rapid literature mapping on the recent use of machine learning for wildlife imagery"  

Aim: systematic survey or machine/deep-learning methods for species/individual/behaviour recognition for animals - identifying gaps and trends.   

Format: Rapid systematic review/map   

Scope: image data (computer vision), wild or semi-wild (include zoo) animals, analyses focus on animal/species individual recognition or behaviour recognition, published inlast 5 years (2017-2021).   

Files:  
- data/mapping_dataset_reconciled.xlsx - raw data and (sheet1) and meta-data (sheet2)  
- data/species.tree - phylogenetic tree of species from the data set, created using rotl package  
- data/scopus_AI_1and2.bib - bibliographic records of included articles downloaded from Scopus, used for bibliometric analyses
