THE PROPOSAL PROVIDES AN ASSESSMENT OF IMAGE QUALITY WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A REFERENCE IMAGE OR A SPECIFIC DISTORTION ASSUMPTION. TWO MAIN PROCESSES HAVE BEEN USED TO BUILD OUR MODELS: THE FIRST ONE USES DEEP LEARNING WITH A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK PROCESS, WITHOUT ANY PREPROCESSING. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE VISUAL QUALITY IS COMPUTED BY POOLING SEVERAL IMAGE FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM DIFFERENT CONCEPTS: THE NATURAL SCENE STATISTIC IN THE SPATIAL DOMAIN, THE GRADIENT MAGNITUDE, THE LAPLACIAN OF GAUSSIAN, AS WELL AS THE SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL ENTROPIES. THE FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE FILE ARE USED AS THE INPUT OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO BUILD THE MODELS THAT ARE USED TO ESTIMATE THE VISUAL QUALITY LEVEL OF ANY IMAGE. FOR THE MACHINE LEARNING TRAINING PHASE, TWO MAIN PROCESSES ARE PROPOSED: THE FIRST PROPOSED PROCESS CONSISTS OF A DIRECT LEARNING USING ALL THE SELECTED FEATURES IN ONLY ONE TRAINING PHASE, NAMED DIRECT LEARNING BLIND VISUAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT DLBQA. THE SECOND PROCESS IS AN INDIRECT LEARNING AND CONSISTS OF TWO TRAINING PHASES, NAMED INDIRECT LEARNING BLIND VISUAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT ILBQA. THIS SECOND PROCESS INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL PHASE OF CONSTRUCTION OF INTERMEDIARY METRICS USED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PREDICTION MODEL. THE PRODUCED MODELS ARE EVALUATED ON MANY BENCHMARKS IMAGE DATABASES AS TID2013, LIVE, AND LIVE IN THE WILD IMAGE QUALITY CHALLENGE. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROPOSED MODELS PRODUCE THE BEST VISUAL PERCEPTION QUALITY PREDICTION, COMPARED TO THE STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS.

IN THIS PAPER, BASED ON GF-2 MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGES OF GUANGXI COASTAL ZONE FROM 2018 TO 2020, THE VEGETATION INDEX METHOD AND FIRST-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL METHOD WERE USED TO RECONSTRUCT SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTIC DATA. BASED ON THE RECONSTRUCTED DATA, THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) CLASSIFICATION METHOD WAS USED TO STUDY THE INTERSPECIFIC CLASSIFICATION OF MANGROVES IN GUANGXI COASTAL ZONE. TAKING MAOWEIHAI AS AN EXAMPLE, THE VALIDITY OF THE RECONSTRUCTED DATA FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF MANGROVE SPECIES WAS VERIFIED BY COMPARING WITH THE CLASSIFICATION RESULTS USING ORIGINAL DATA AND THE FIRST-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL METHOD. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF THE RECONSTRUCTED DATA BASED ON SPECTRAL FEATURES WAS THE HIGHEST (91.55%) AND THE KAPPA COEFFICIENT WAS 0.8695, WHICH WAS 6.92% HIGHER THAN THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY USING ORIGINAL DATA AND 11.17% HIGHER THAN THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY USING FIRST-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL METHOD. BASED ON THIS, MANGROVE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IN GUANGXI COASTAL ZONE WAS FURTHER CARRIED OUT USING THE SPECTRAL FEATURE RECONSTRUCTION DATA. MANGROVES IN GUANGXI CAN BE DIVIDED INTO EIGHT TYPES, NAMELY, AEGICERAS CORNICULATUM, AVICENNIA MARINA, RHIZOPHORA STYLOSA, SONNERATIA APETALA, KANDELIA CANDEL, BRUGUIERA GYMNORRHIZA, ACANTHUS ILICIFOLIUS, AND A SALT MARSH HERBACEOUS PLANT CYPERUS MALACCENSIS. THE TOTAL AREA OF TYPICAL VEGETATION FOR ALL TYPES OF WETLANDS WAS 7402.98 HM2. THE AREA OF MANGROVE IN FANGCHENGGANG CITY, QINZHOU CITY, AND BEIHAI CITY WAS 1826.16 HM2, 2496.18 HM2, AND 3080.47 HM2, RESPECTIVELY. THE DOMINANT SPECIES OF MANGROVE IN GUANGXI WERE AEGICERAS CORNICULATUM AND AVICENNIA MARINA, WITH THE LARGEST DISTRIBUTION AREA OF 3372.09 HM2 AND 3445.17 HM2, RESPECTIVELY, ACCOUNTING FOR 92.09% OF THE TOTAL AREA. NEXT CAME THE CYPERUS MALACCENSIS WITH AN AREA OF 287.50 HM2, ACCOUNTING FOR 3.88% OF THE TOTAL AREA OF THE MANGROVES, FOLLOWED BY RHIZOPHORA STYLOSA AND SONNERATIA APETALA, WITH AN AREA OF 135.97 HM2 AND 126.52 HM2, RESPECTIVELY, ACCOUNTING FOR 3.55% OF THE TOTAL AREA OF MANGROVES. THE AREA OF KANDELIA CANDEL, BRUGUIERA GYMNORRHIZA, AND ACANTHUS ILICIFOLIUS WERE ALL LESS THAN 20 HM2, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN 1% OF THE TOTAL MANGROVE AREA. THE TOTAL AREA OF MANGROVE IN BEILUN ESTUARY, SHANKOU, AND MAWEIHAI SEA MANGROVE NATURE RESERVES WAS 1009.21 HM2, 715.56 HM2 AND 1546.62 HM2, RESPECTIVELY.

UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM (UAS)-BASED REMOTE SENSING HAS THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE HIGH-RESOLUTION, CONTINUOUS SPATIAL DATA THAT CAN BE USED TO DETECT FOREST INVASION DYNAMICS. IN THIS STUDY, UAS-BASED RGB AND MULTISPECTRAL IMAGE DATA AND DIGITAL AERIAL PHOTOGRAMMETRIC POINT CLOUD (PPC) WERE ACQUIRED AND USED TO DETECT AREAS OF BAMBOO INVASION IN A SUBTROPICAL FOREST OF SOUTHERN CHINA. FIRST, A POINT CLOUD SEGMENTATION (PCS) METHOD WAS APPLIED FOR INDIVIDUAL TREE DETECTION (ITD) USING PHOTOGRAMMETRIC POINT CLOUDS (PPCS). A RANDOM FOREST (RF) CLASSIFIER WAS USED TO PERFORM TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION BASED ON PPC METRICS, VEGETATION INDICES, AND TEXTURE METRICS. FINALLY, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE ITD AND TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION, ALPHA-DIVERSITY (I.E., THE SPECIES RICHNESS (S), SHANNON-WIENER (H’), SIMPSON (D), AND PIELOU'S EVENNESS INDEX(J)) AND THE SPATIAL VARIATION IN SPECIES COMPOSITION ALONG THE ALTITUDE GRADIENT (BETA-DIVERSITY) IN THE INVADED FORESTS WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT PCS WORKED WELL FOR TREE DETECTION IN INVADED FORESTS (F1-SCORE = 80.63%), AND THE OVERALL ACCURACY OF TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION WAS 75.69%, WITH A KAPPA ACCURACY OF 73.76%. THE FOREST DIVERSITY ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT ALL ALPHA-DIVERSITY VALUES WERE GENERALLY PREDICTED WELL (R2 = 0.84–0.91, RMSE = 0.05–0.84). THE DIVERSITY SHOWED A DECREASING TENDENCY WITH INCREASING BAMBOO INVASION, AND THE PREDOMINANTLY BROAD-LEAVED INVADED FORESTS HAD HIGHER DIVERSITY THAN THE PREDOMINANTLY CONIFEROUS INVADED FORESTS. THE HUMAN INTERVENTION HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON BAMBOO INVASION. THE ANOVA OF THE DISPERSION OF THE DISSIMILARITIES ALONG THE ELEVATION GRADIENT SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN ABUNDANCE-WEIGHTED SIMILARITY AMONG THE ALTITUDE CLASSES (ANOVA OF THE BRAY-CURTIS DISSIMILARITY, F4,40 = 6.453, P = 0.0004***; ANOVA OF THE JACCARD DISSIMILARITY, F4,40 = 5.20, P = 0.0017**). THIS STUDY INDICATED THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF USING UAS- BASED REMOTE SENSING DATA TO IDENTIFY TREE SPECIES AND PREDICT FOREST DIVERSITY IN BAMBOO-INVADED FORESTS.

HOWEVER, RESPONSES OF SPECIES TO ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACT ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE. IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION STRATEGIES, IT IS CRITICAL TO DETERMINE A SPECIES’ ABILITY TO PERSIST IN DEGRADED HABITATS. HERE, WE USED CAMERA TRAPPING DATA TO PROVIDE THE FIRST INSIGHTS INTO THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SOUTHERN PIG-TAILED MACAQUES (MACACA NEMESTRINA, LISTED AS ‘VULNERABLE’ BY THE IUCN) ACROSS INTACT AND DEGRADED FOREST HABITATS IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE EFFECTS OF CLEAR-CUTTING AND SELECTIVE LOGGING ON MACAQUE OCCUPANCY. SPECIFICALLY, WE FOUND A 10% DECLINE IN MACAQUE SITE OCCUPANCY IN THE HIGHLY DEGRADED PASOH FOREST RESERVE FROM 2013 TO 2017. THIS MAY BE STRONGLY LINKED TO THE MACAQUES’ SENSITIVITY TO INTENSIVE DISTURBANCE THROUGH CLEAR-CUTTING, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE PROBABILITY THAT M. NEMESTRINA BECAME LOCALLY EXTINCT AT A PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED SITE. HOWEVER, WE FOUND NO CLEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MODERATE DISTURBANCE, I.E., SELECTIVE LOGGING, AND THE MACAQUES’ LOCAL EXTINCTION PROBABILITY OR SITE OCCUPANCY IN THE PASOH FOREST RESERVE AND BELUM-TEMENGOR FOREST COMPLEX. FURTHER, AN IDENTICAL AGE AND SEX STRUCTURE OF MACAQUES IN SELECTIVELY LOGGED AND COMPLETELY UNDISTURBED HABITAT TYPES WITHIN THE BELUM-TEMENGOR FOREST COMPLEX INDICATED THAT THE MACAQUES DID NOT SHOW INCREASED MORTALITY OR DECLINING BIRTH RATES WHEN EXPOSED TO SELECTIVE LOGGING. OVERALL, THIS SUGGESTS THAT LOW TO MODERATELY DISTURBED FORESTS MAY STILL CONSTITUTE VALUABLE HABITATS THAT SUPPORT VIABLE POPULATIONS OF M. NEMESTRINA, AND THUS NEED TO BE PROTECTED AGAINST FURTHER DEGRADATION. OUR RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF POPULATION MONITORING THROUGH CAMERA TRAPPING FOR UNDERSTANDING THE ABILITY OF THREATENED SPECIES TO COPE WITH ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE.

FIRSTLY, MOST EXISTING METHODS FINE-TUNE THE IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-ORIENTED PRE-TRAINED MODELS FOR THE ABSENCE OF LARGE-SCALE I/VQA DATASETS.

THE METHOD IS BASED ON THE CONTINUOUS REGISTRATION OF ANIMALS ON SITES FORMED BY THE DETECTION ZONES OF CAMERA TRAPS WITH SUBSEQUENT EXTRAPOLATION OF THE RESULTS TO THE ENTIRE STUDY AREA. A MUCH SIMPLER MATHEMATICAL APPARATUS IS THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR PROPOSED METHOD AND OTHER METHODS OF ACCOUNTING BY CAMERA TRAPS, WHICH ALLOWS IT TO BE APPLIED BY A WIDE RANGE OF USERS. BOTH THE POSITIONAL MEASURES AND THE SCATTERING MEASURES NECESSARY FOR SUBSEQUENT STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ARE CALCULATED QUITE EASILY. FURTHERMORE, ONE OF OUR METHOD’S ADVANTAGES IS THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO KNOW THE SPEED OF ANIMAL MOVEMENT, THE MOST DIFFICULT PARAMETER TO CALCULATE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SNOWLESS PERIOD OF THE YEAR. AN EXAMPLE OF USING THE BOOTSTRAP METHOD IS GIVEN FOR THE CASE WHEN THE INPUT DATA DISTRIBUTION PARAMETERS DO NOT CORRESPOND TO THE NORMAL ONES. USING THE DE MOIVRE–LAPLACE THEOREM, THE PROBABILITY THAT THE ANIMALS RESTING IN THEIR BEDS WOULD GET INTO THE DETECTION ZONE OF THE CAMERA TRAP MATRICES IS ESTIMATED, WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE CORRECT USE OF THE METHOD PROPOSED. SOLUTIONS ARE PROPOSED FOR CASES WHEN THIS PROBABILITY IS LOW. THE PROBLEMS OF OUR PROPOSED METHOD AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS ARE DESCRIBED.

BECAUSE NO UNIVERSAL METHOD IS AVAILABLE FOR CONTROLLING ALL TERMITES, CORRECT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IS CRUCIAL FOR TERMITE MANAGEMENT. DESPITE DEEP NEURAL NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES' PROMISING PERFORMANCE IN PEST RECOGNITION, A METHOD FOR AUTOMATIC TERMITE RECOGNITION REMAINS LACKING. TO DEVELOP AN AUTOMATED DEEP LEARNING CLASSIFIER FOR TERMITE IMAGE RECOGNITION SUITABLE FOR MOBILE APPLICATIONS, WE USED SMARTPHONES TO ACQUIRE 18,000 ORIGINAL IMAGES EACH OF FOUR TERMITE PEST SPECIES: KALOTERMITIDAE: CRYPTOTERMES DOMESTICUS (HAVILAND); RHINOTERMITIDAE: COPTOTERMES FORMOSANUS SHIRAKI AND RETICULITERMES FLAVICEPS (OSHIMA); AND TERMITIDAE: ODONTOTERMES FORMOSANUS (SHIRAKI). EACH ORIGINAL IMAGE INCLUDED MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS, AND WE APPLIED FIVE IMAGE SEGMENTATION TECHNIQUES FOR CAPTURING INDIVIDUAL TERMITES. WE USED 24,000 INDIVIDUAL-TERMITE IMAGES (4 SPECIES × 2 CASTES × 3 GROUPS × 1,000 IMAGES) FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING. WE IMPLEMENTED A TERMITE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM BY USING A DEEP LEARNING-BASED MODEL, MOBILENETV2. OUR MODELS ACHIEVED HIGH ACCURACY SCORES OF 0.947, 0.946, AND 0.929 FOR IDENTIFYING SOLDIERS, WORKERS, AND BOTH CASTES, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM HUMAN EXPERT PERFORMANCE. WE FURTHER APPLIED IMAGE AUGMENTATION TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING GEOMETRICAL TRANSFORMATIONS AND INTENSITY TRANSFORMATIONS, TO INDIVIDUAL-TERMITE IMAGES. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE SAME CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USING 1,000 AUGMENTED IMAGES DERIVED FROM ONLY 200 INDIVIDUAL-TERMITE IMAGES, THUS FACILITATING FURTHER MODEL DEVELOPMENT ON THE BASIS OF MANY FEWER ORIGINAL IMAGES.

DEEP LEARNING, A SUBDISCIPLINE OF MACHINE LEARNING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE, CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFYING CAMERA-TRAP IMAGES WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY. THIS TECHNIQUE, HOWEVER, MAY BE LESS ACCESSIBLE TO ECOLOGISTS OR SMALL-SCALE CONSERVATION PROJECTS, AND HAS SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. IN THIS STUDY, WE TRAINED A SIMPLE DEEP LEARNING MODEL USING A DATASET OF 120,000 IMAGES TO IDENTIFY THE PRESENCE OF NILGAI BOSELAPHUS TRAGOCAMELUS, A REGIONALLY SPECIFIC NONNATIVE GAME ANIMAL, IN CAMERA-TRAP IMAGES WITH AN OVERALL ACCURACY OF 97%. WE TRAINED A SECOND MODEL TO IDENTIFY 20 GROUPS OF ANIMALS AND ONE GROUP OF IMAGES WITHOUT ANY ANIMALS PRESENT, LABELED AS ‘‘NONE,’’ WITH AN ACCURACY OF 89%. LASTLY, WE TESTED THE MULTIGROUP MODEL ON IMAGES COLLECTED OF SIMILAR SPECIES, BUT IN THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PRECISION AND RECALL FOR EACH GROUP. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL OF DEEP LEARNING FOR AUTOMATING CAMERA-TRAP IMAGE PROCESSING WORKFLOWS, PROVIDES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF IMAGE-BASED DEEP LEARNING, AND DISCUSSES THE OFTEN-UNDERSTATED LIMITATIONS AND METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND SPECIES MONITORING.

PRE-PROCESSING STEPS INCLUDE COLOR NORMALIZATION AND ENHANCEMENT, SCALING DOWN, ROTATION, AND CROPPING OF PICTURES TO PRODUCE A SERIES OF IMAGES OF FACES WITH CONSISTENT DIMENSIONS. SIXTY-EIGHT FACIAL LANDMARKS ARE AUTOMATICALLY LOCATED ON EACH FACE THROUGH A CASCADE OF REGRESSION FUNCTIONS LEARNT VIA GRADIENT BOOSTING TO ESTIMATE THE SHAPE FROM AN INITIAL APPROXIMATION. THE INTENSITIES OF A SPARSE SET OF PIXELS INDEXED RELATIVE TO THIS INITIAL ESTIMATE ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE LANDMARKS. A SET OF CAREFULLY SELECTED GEOMETRIC FEATURES, FOR EXAMPLE, THE RELATIVE WIDTH OF THE MOUTH OR ANGLE OF THE NOSE, IS EXTRACTED FROM THE LANDMARKS. THE FEATURES ARE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE STATISTICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO POPULATIONS OF PTHS AND HEALTHY CONTROLS.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO INTRODUCE A SEMI-AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW TO SEGMENT IRREGULARLY ALIGNED PLOTS AND SUB-PLOTS IN BREEDING POPULATIONS. IMAGERY FROM A REPLICATED LENTIL DIVERSITY PANEL PHENOTYPING EXPERIMENT WITH 324 POPULATIONS WAS USED FOR THIS STUDY. IMAGE-BASED TECHNIQUES USING A CONVOLUTION FILTER ON AN EXCESS GREEN INDEX (EXG) WERE USED TO ENHANCE AND HIGHLIGHT PLOT ROWS AND, THUS, LOCATE THE PLOT CENTER. MULTI-THRESHOLD AND WATERSHED SEGMENTATION WERE THEN COMBINED TO SEPARATE PLANTS, GROUND, AND SUB-PLOT WITHIN PLOTS. ALGORITHMS OF LOCAL MAXIMA AND PIXEL RESIZING WITH SURFACE TENSION PARAMETERS WERE USED TO DETECT THE CENTERS OF SUB-PLOTS. A TOTAL OF 3489 REFERENCE DATA POINTS WAS COLLECTED ON 30 RANDOM PLOTS FOR ACCURACY ASSESSMENT. IT WAS FOUND THAT ALL PLOTS AND SUB-PLOTS WERE SUCCESSFULLY EXTRACTED WITH AN OVERALL PLOT EXTRACTION ACCURACY OF 92%.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER VISION PROVIDES A POSSIBILITY FOR CONVENIENT, FAST, AND INTELLIGENT MINERAL RECOGNITION. RECENTLY, SEVERAL MINERAL RECOGNITION METHODS BASED ON IMAGES USING A NEURAL NETWORK HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR THIS AIM. HOWEVER, THESE METHODS DO NOT EXPLOIT FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM THE BACKBONE NETWORK OR AVAILABLE INFORMATION OF THE SAMPLES IN THE MINERAL DATASET SUFFICIENTLY, RESULTING IN LOW RECOGNITION ACCURACY. IN THIS PAPER, A METHOD BASED ON FEATURE FUSION AND ONLINE HARD SAMPLE MINING IS PROPOSED TO IMPROVE RECOGNITION ACCURACY BY USING ONLY MINERAL PHOTO IMAGES. THIS METHOD FIRST FUSES MULTI-RESOLUTION FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM RESNET-50 TO OBTAIN COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION OF MINERAL PHOTOS, AND THEN PROPOSES THE WEIGHTED TOP-K LOSS TO EMPHASIZE THE LEARNING OF HARD SAMPLES. BASED ON A DATASET CONSISTING OF 14,986 IMAGES OF 22 COMMON MINERALS, THE PROPOSED METHOD WITH 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION ACHIEVES A TOP1 ACCURACY OF 88.01% ON THE VALIDATION IMAGE SET, SURPASSING THOSE OF INCEPTION-V3 AND EFFICIENTNET-B0 BY A MARGIN OF 1.88% AND 1.29%, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH DEMONSTRATES THE GOOD PROSPECT OF THE PROPOSED METHOD FOR CONVENIENT AND RELIABLE MINERAL RECOGNITION USING MINERAL PHOTOS ONLY. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

WE EVALUATED OBJECT DETECTION ALGORITHMS AND POINT PATTERN ANALYSIS, USING FOOTAGE FROM DRONE ALTITUDES RANGING FROM 15 M TO 130 M. WE APPLIED TRANSFER LEARNING TO STATE-OF-THE-ART LIGHTWEIGHT OBJECT DETECTION ALGORITHMS (TENSORFLOW AND YOLO) BASED ON FEATURE EXTRACTION. IN THE POINT PATTERN ANALYSIS, WE TREATED EACH ANIMAL AS A POINT AND IDENTIFIED THEM BY THE BEHAVIOURAL PATTERN OF THOSE POINTS. THE FIVE ANIMAL SPECIES INVESTIGATED WERE AFRICAN ELEPHANT (LOXODONTA AFRICANA), GIRAFFE (GIRAFFA CAMELOPARDALIS), WHITE RHINOCEROS (CERATOTHERIUM SIMUM), WILDEBEEST (CONNOCHAETES TAURINUS) AND ZEBRA (EQUUS QUAGGAS). AS WE INCREASED THE ALTITUDE OF THE DRONE CAMERA, THE DETECTION ALGORITHMS USING FEATURES SIGNIFICANTLY LOST ACCURACY. ANIMAL FEATURES ARE HARDER TO DETECT AT HIGHER ALTITUDES AND IN THE PRESENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CAMOUFLAGE, ANIMAL OCCLUSION, AND SHADOWS. THE PERFORMANCE OF LIGHTWEIGHT OBJECT DETECTION ALGORITHMS (F1 SCORE) DECREASED WITH INCREASING DRONE ALTITUDE TO A MINIMUM OF 29%, WHILE THE POINT PATTERN ALGORITHMS PRODUCED AN F1 SCORE ABOVE 96% ACROSS ALL DRONE ALTITUDES. USING POINT PATTERN ANALYSIS, THE ACCURACY OF ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION IS INVARIANT TO DRONE CAMERA ALTITUDE AND DISTURBANCES FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.

HOWEVER, THE TERM “WALKABILITY” IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH TWO RELATED BUT DISTINCT WALKING BEHAVIORS: INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE WALKING BEHAVIORS. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER SPATIAL DISPARITY EXISTS BETWEEN THEM, AND WHETHER BUILT ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERISTICS HAVE DISTINCTIVE EFFECTS ON THEM. THIS RESEARCH WAS THE FIRST TO EXPLORE THE SPATIAL DISPARITY BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF WALKING BEHAVIORS. COLLECTIVE WALKING BEHAVIORS WERE MEASURED USING THE CITYWIDE PEDESTRIAN VOLUME, EXTRACTED FROM 219,248 STREET VIEW IMAGES. INDIVIDUAL WALKING BEHAVIORS WERE MEASURED FORM A POPULATION-LEVEL SURVEY. SPATIAL MISMATCHES WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF WALKING BEHAVIORS AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT ELEMENTS HAD STRONGER ASSOCIATIONS WITH COLLECTIVE WALKING BEHAVIORS. THEREFORE, IT IS PRUDENT TO THEORETICALLY DIFFERENTIATE COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL WALKING BEHAVIORS, AND TARGETED PLANNING POLICIES MUST BE DEVELOPED TO PROMOTE ONE OR BOTH TYPES OF WALKING BEHAVIORS. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD",103096,BUILT ENVIRONMENT; MACHINE LEARNING; SPATIAL DISPARITY; STREET VIEW IMAGES; WALKABILITY; WALKING,TRDTF,"LU, Y.; DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE AND CIVIL ENGINEERING, HONG KONG; EMAIL: YILU24@CITYU.EDU.HK",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103096,NA,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA, NSFC, 51778552 RESEARCH GRANTS COUNCIL, UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMITTEERESEARCH GRANTS COUNCIL, UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMITTEE, 研究資助局, CITYU11207520",NA,13619209,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D: TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT,ENGLISH,CITED BY 9,NA,NA,ELSEVIER LTD,NA,SCOPUS,SPATIAL DISPARITY OF INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE WALKING BEHAVIORS: A NEW THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119098384&doi=10.1016%2fj.trd.2021.103096&partnerID=40&md5=e6607691ee1ac5a75e523319ed720963,101,2021,THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER WAS FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE GRANTS FROM NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (PROJECT NO. 51778552) AND THE RESEARCH GRANTS COUNCIL OF THE HONG KONG SAR (PROJECT NO.

USE OF DRONE IMAGERY COUPLED WITH APPLICATION OF RAPIDLY ADVANCING DEEP LEARNING TECHNOLOGY COULD GREATLY REDUCE THE EFFORT AND COST OF COLLECTING AND ANALYZING POPULATION-LEVEL DATA ACROSS RELATIVELY LARGE AREAS. WE USED A CUSTOMIZATION OF THE YOLOV5 OBJECT DETECTION MODEL TO IDENTIFY AND COUNT INDIVIDUAL DWARF BEAR POPPY (ARCTOMECON HUMILIS) PLANTS IN DRONE IMAGERY OBTAINED AT 40 M ALTITUDE. WE COMPARED HUMAN-BASED AND MODEL-BASED DETECTION AT 40 M ON N = 11 TEST PLOTS FOR TWO AREAS THAT DIFFERED IN IMAGE QUALITY. THE MODEL OUT-PERFORMED HUMAN VISUAL POPPY DETECTION FOR PRECISION AND RECALL, AND WAS 1100× FASTER AT INFERENCE/EVALUATION ON THE TEST PLOTS. MODEL INFERENCE PRECISION WAS 0.83, AND RECALL WAS 0.74, WHILE HUMAN EVALUATION RESULTED IN PRECISION OF 0.67, AND RECALL OF 0.71.

THERE ARE ABOUT 1500 SPECIES OF CHENOPODIACEAE THAT ARE SPREAD WORLDWIDE AND OFTEN ARE ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT. BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION OF THESE SPECIES IS CRITICAL DUE TO THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES ON THEM. FOR THIS PURPOSE, IDENTIFICATION AND SURVEILLANCE OF CHENOPODIACEAE SPECIES IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT ARE NECESSARY AND CAN BE FACILITATED BY DEEP LEARNING. THE FEASIBILITY OF APPLYING DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO IDENTIFY CHENOPODIACEAE SPECIES DEPENDS ON ACCESS TO THE APPROPRIATE RELEVANT DATASET. THEREFORE, ACHENY DATASET WAS COLLECTED FROM NATURAL HABITATS OF DIFFERENT BUSHES OF CHENOPODIACEAE SPECIES, IN REAL-WORLD CONDITIONS FROM DESERT AND SEMI-DESERT AREAS OF THE YAZD PROVINCE OF IRAN. THIS IMBALANCED DATASET IS COMPILED OF 27,030 RGB COLOR IMAGES FROM 30 CHENOPODIACEAE SPECIES, EACH SPECIES 300-1461 IMAGES. IMAGING IS PERFORMED FROM MULTIPLE BUSHES FOR EACH SPECIES, WITH DIFFERENT CAMERA-TO-TARGET DISTANCES, VIEWPOINTS, ANGLES, AND NATURAL SUNLIGHT IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. THE COLLECTED IMAGES ARE NOT PRE-PROCESSED, ONLY ARE RESIZED TO 224 × 224 DIMENSIONS WHICH CAN BE USED ON SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL DEEP LEARNING MODELS AND THEN WERE GROUPED INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE CLASS.

IN THE LAST DECADE, SEVERAL RESEARCH EFFORTS HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO DEVISE ALGORITHMIC SOLUTIONS FOR THIS ISSUE. RECENT ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE DOMAIN SHIFT HAVE RESULTED INTO DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR DOMAIN ADAPTATION WHICH LEARN DOMAIN-INVARIANT REPRESENTATIONS BY INTRODUCING APPROPRIATE LOSS TERMS, BY CASTING THE PROBLEM WITHIN AN ADVERSARIAL LEARNING FRAMEWORK OR BY EMBEDDING INTO DEEP NETWORK SPECIFIC DOMAIN NORMALIZATION LAYERS. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A NOVEL APPROACH FOR UNSUPERVISED DOMAIN ADAPTATION. SIMILARLY TO PREVIOUS WORKS WE PROPOSE TO ALIGN THE LEARNED REPRESENTATIONS BY EMBEDDING THEM INTO APPROPRIATE NETWORK FEATURE NORMALIZATION LAYERS. OPPOSITE TO PREVIOUS WORKS, OUR DOMAIN ALIGNMENT LAYERS ARE DESIGNED NOT ONLY TO MATCH THE SOURCE AND TARGET FEATURE DISTRIBUTIONS BUT ALSO TO AUTOMATICALLY LEARN THE DEGREE OF FEATURE ALIGNMENT REQUIRED AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE DEEP NETWORK. DIFFERENTLY FROM MOST PREVIOUS DEEP DOMAIN ADAPTATION METHODS, OUR APPROACH IS ABLE TO OPERATE IN A MULTI-SOURCE SETTING.

HOWEVER, UAS FLIGHT PLANNING CAN BE SUBJECTIVE, RESULTING IN INEFFECTIVE USE OF FLIGHT TIME AND OVERCOLLECTION OF IMAGERY. THIS STUDY USED A MAXENT MACHINE-LEARNING PREDICTIVE MODEL TO CREATE TARGETED FLIGHT AREAS TO MONITOR GEUM RADIATUM, AN ENDANGERED PLANT ENDEMIC TO THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS IN NORTH CAROLINA. THE MAXENT MODEL WAS DEVELOPED WITH TEN ENVIRONMENTAL LAYERS AS PREDICTORS AND KNOWN PLANT LOCATIONS AS TRAINING DATA. UAS FLIGHT AREAS WERE DERIVED FROM THE RESULTING PROBABILITY RASTER AS ISOLINES DELINEATED FROM A PROBABILITY THRESHOLD BASED ON FLIGHT PARAMETERS. VISUAL ANALYSIS OF UAS IMAGERY VERIFIED THE LOCATIONS OF 33 KNOWN PLANTS AND DISCOVERED FOUR PREVIOUSLY UNDOCU-MENTED OCCURRENCES. SEMI-AUTOMATED DETECTION OF PLANT SPECIES WAS EXPLORED USING A NEURAL NETWORK OBJECT DETECTOR. ALTHOUGH THE APPROACH WAS SUCCESSFUL IN DETECTING PLANTS IN ON-GROUND IM-AGES, NO PLANTS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE UAS AERIAL IMAGERY, INDICATING THAT FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED IN BOTH DATA ACQUISITION AND COMPUTER VISION TECHNIQUES. DESPITE THIS LIMITATION, THE PRE-SENTED RESEARCH PROVIDES A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO PLAN TARGETED UAS FLIGHT AREAS FROM PREDICTIVE MODELING, IMPROVING UAS DATA COLLECTION FOR RARE PLANT MONITORING. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

ADD FIRST LOCATES POTENTIALLY MANIPULATED AREAS OF THE INPUT IMAGE TO EXTRACT REPRESENTATIVE FEATURES. SECOND, THE DETECTION MODEL IS FORCED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THESE FORGERY REGIONS IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS THROUGH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON INTERPRETING THE SAMPLE IN THE LEARNING PHASE. ADD’S PERFORMANCE IS EVALUATED AGAINST TWO CHALLENGING DATASETS OF DEEPFAKE FORENSICS, I.E., CELEB-DF (V2) AND WILDDEEPFAKE. WE DEMONSTRATED THE GENERALIZATION OF ADD BY EVALUATING FOUR POPULAR CLASSIFIERS, NAMELY VGGNET, RESNET, XCEPTION, AND MOBILENET.

NAT.,"CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS RELY ON SOCIAL/INTERNET MEDIA PLATFORMS TO RAISE AWARENESS AND FUNDRAISE. SOCIAL MEDIA IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD: IT CAN BE A WIDE-REACHING AND EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR EDUCATION AND FUNDRAISING, BUT CAN ALSO HAVE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IMPACTS ON PUBLIC VIEWS TOWARDS WILDLIFE AND UNDERSTANDING OF WILDLIFE CONSERVATION. FOR EXAMPLE, DEPICTING HUMANS INTERACTING WITH WILDLIFE IN MEDIA MAY INCREASE VIDEO POPULARITY, BUT ANIMALS SHOWN IN ANTHROPOGENIC CONTEXTS ARE ALSO VIEWED AS APPEALING PETS. WE ARE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING WHETHER THIS IS TRUE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS (YOUTUBE VIDEOS) BY ORANGUTAN RESCUE AND REHABILITATION ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH RELY ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR FUNDRAISING AND AWARENESS RAISING. OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE DATA AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO GUIDE THESE ORGANIZATIONS IN BUILDING MEDIA WITH POSITIVE CONSERVATION IMPACT WHILE MINIMIZING POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS. USING YOUTUBE ANALYTICS AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF COMMENTS ON 117 VIDEOS, WE ASK HOW VIEWER RESPONSES TO VIDEOS VARY WITH (A) THE AMOUNT OF HUMAN–ORANGUTAN INTERACTION DEPICTED, (B) THE AGES OF THE ORANGUTANS FEATURED AND (C) THE MENTION OF THREATS TO ORANGUTANS. VIDEOS WITH LONGER HUMAN–ORANGUTAN INTERACTION TIME WERE VIEWED MORE, BUT COMMENTS ON THEM WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE NEGATIVE TOWARDS INDONESIAN/MALAYSIAN PEOPLE. COMMENTS ON ORANGUTAN RESCUE/REHABILITATION VIDEOS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE CATEGORIZED AS NEGATIVE FOR ORANGUTAN CONSERVATION COMPARED TO VIDEOS ABOUT ORANGUTANS GENERALLY, AND WITHIN THESE, SO WERE COMMENTS ON VIDEOS FEATURING INFANT AND JUVENILE ORANGUTANS. BASED ON OUR FINDINGS, WE RECOMMEND THAT ORANGUTAN RESCUE AND REHABILITATION ORGANIZATIONS FEATURE ADULT AND MIXED AGE GROUPS OF ORANGUTANS RATHER THAN INFANTS AND JUVENILES, MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF HUMAN–ORANGUTAN INTERACTION SHOWN AND TALK ABOUT CONSERVATION THREATS TO ORANGUTANS IN THEIR VIDEOS.

HOWEVER, THE COMMON EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE FACE IMAGES GIVEN AS INPUT TO THE NEURAL NETWORKS ARE OFTEN AFFECTED BY STRONG CORRUPTIONS NOT ALWAYS REPRESENTED IN STANDARD DATASETS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE AN EXPERIMENTAL FRAMEWORK FOR GENDER RECOGNITION “IN THE WILD”. WE PRODUCE A CORRUPTED VERSION OF THE POPULAR LFW+ AND GENDER-FERET DATASETS, THAT WE CALL LFW+C AND GENDER-FERET-C, AND EVALUATE THE ACCURACY OF NINE DIFFERENT NETWORK ARCHITECTURES IN PRESENCE OF SPECIFIC, SUITABLY DESIGNED, CORRUPTIONS; IN ADDITION, WE PERFORM AN EXPERIMENT ON THE MIVIA-GENDER DATASET, RECORDED IN REAL ENVIRONMENTS, TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF MIXED IMAGE CORRUPTIONS HAPPENING IN THE WILD.

THE FORMER CAN AGGREGATE MULTI-LEVEL SPATIAL FEATURES TO ADAPT TO THE VARIABILITY OF UVS' SHAPES AND SCALES, WHILE THE LATTER EXTRACTED GLOBAL SEMANTIC FEATURES TO IMPROVE THE INTER-CLASS DIVISIBILITY. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS IN BEIJING CITY SHOWED THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL ACHIEVED GOOD PERFORMANCE WITH AN OVERALL ACCURACY OF 94.27% AND A KAPPA COEFFICIENT OF 0.883 9, WHICH WAS BETTER THAN THAT OF SEVERAL PREVIOUS DEEP LEARNING MODELS SUCH AS VGG, RESNET AND DENSENET. THE RESEARCH RESULT DEMONSTRATED THAT BY USING THE DEEP LEARNING MODEL, IT WAS FEASIBLE AND EFFECTIVE TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY UVS FROM VHR REMOTE SENSING IMAGES, WHICH COULD PROVIDE USEFUL GEO-SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF UVS FOR URBAN-RURAL PLANNING. © 2021, CHINESE SOCIETY OF AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY.

CF REFERS TO THE SIGNIFICANT DEGRADATION IN PERFORMANCE ON THE OLD TASK/DATASET. IN THIS PAPER, A NOVEL APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO ADDRESS CF IN COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS (CAD) SYSTEM DESIGN IN THE MEDICAL DOMAIN. CAD SYSTEMS OFTEN NEED TO HANDLE A SEQUENCE OF DATASETS COLLECTED OVER TIME FROM DIFFERENT SITES WITH DIFFERENT IMAGING PARAMETERS/POPULATIONS. THE SOLUTION WE PROPOSE IS TO MOVE SAMPLES FROM ALL THE DATASETS CLOSER TO A COMMON MANIFOLD VIA A REFORMER AT THE FRONT END OF A CAD SYSTEM. THE UTILITY OF THIS APPROACH IS DEMONSTRATED ON TWO COMMON TASKS, NAMELY SEGMENTATION AND CLASSIFICATION, USING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASETS. RESULTS OF EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT MANIFOLD LEARNING CAN YIELD ABOUT 74% IMPROVEMENT ON AN AVERAGE IN THE REDUCTION OF CF OVER THE BASELINE FINE-TUNING PROCESS AND THE STATE-OF-THE-ART REGULARIZATION BASED METHODS. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT A REFORMER WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART REGULARIZATION METHODS, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO YIELD FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN CF REDUCTION. © 2021 ACM.",3490287,AUTOENCODERS; CASTASTROPHIC FORGETTING; CONTINUAL LEARNING; MANIFOLD LEARNING; MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS,NA,NA,CONFERENCE PAPER,10.1145/3490035.3490287,NA,NA,9781450391276,NA,ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDING SERIES,ENGLISH,CITED BY 0,NA,NA,ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY,NA,SCOPUS,MANIFOLD LEARNING TO ADDRESS CATASTROPHIC FORGETTING,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122040263&doi=10.1145%2f3490035.3490287&partnerID=40&md5=d94b4acdac42d86757c4adccef291fba,NA,2021,"NA NA NA","INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TELANGANA, HYDERABAD, INDIA",ISI,0,none,INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,NA,"AKUNDI P, 2021, ","AKUNDI P, 2021, "

RECENT DEEP LEARNING (DL) SOLUTIONS FOR THIS PROBLEM SELECT CLEAN SAMPLES FOR TRAINING BY USING TWO OR MORE NETWORKS SIMULTANEOUSLY. BASED ON THE OBSERVATION THAT WRONGLY ANNOTATED SAMPLES HAVE INCONSISTENT PREDICTIONS COMPARED TO CLEAN SAMPLES WHEN TRANSFORMED USING DIFFERENT AUGMENTATIONS, WE PROPOSE A SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE SINGLE NETWORK FER FRAMEWORK ROBUST TO NOISY ANNOTATIONS.

THE THRESHOLD IS DYNAMICALLY TUNED. THE QUALIFIED CLEAN SAMPLES FACILITATE SUPERVISION DURING TRAINING. FURTHER, TO LEARN HARD SAMPLES (CORRECTLY LABELED BUT DIFFICULT TO CLASSIFY), WE ENFORCE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE PREDICTED DISTRIBUTIONS OF WEAK AND STRONG AUGMENTED VERSIONS OF EVERY TRAINING IMAGE THROUGH A CONSISTENCY LOSS. COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIMENTS ON FER DATASETS LIKE RAFDB, FERPLUS, CURATED FEC AND AFFECTNET IN THE PRESENCE OF BOTH SYNTHETIC AND REAL NOISY ANNOTATION SETTINGS DEMONSTRATE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE PROPOSED METHOD.

MEAS. TECH.,"MIXED-PHASE SOUTHERN OCEAN CLOUDS ARE CHALLENGING TO SIMULATE, AND THEIR REPRESENTATION IN CLIMATE MODELS IS AN IMPORTANT CONTROL ON CLIMATE SENSITIVITY. IN PARTICULAR, THE AMOUNT OF SUPERCOOLED WATER AND FROZEN MASS THAT THEY CONTAIN IN THE PRESENT CLIMATE IS A PREDICTOR OF THEIR PLANETARY FEEDBACK IN A WARMING CLIMATE. THE RECENT SOUTHERN OCEAN CLOUDS, RADIATION, AEROSOL TRANSPORT EXPERIMENTAL STUDY (SOCRATES) VASTLY INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF IN SITU DATA AVAILABLE FROM MIXED-PHASE SOUTHERN OCEAN CLOUDS USEFUL FOR MODEL EVALUATION. BULK MEASUREMENTS DISTINGUISHING LIQUID AND ICE WATER CONTENT ARE NOT AVAILABLE FROM SOCRATES, SO SINGLE-PARTICLE PHASE CLASSIFICATIONS FROM THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL STEREO (2D-S) PROBE ARE INVALUABLE FOR QUANTIFYING MIXED-PHASE CLOUD PROPERTIES. MOTIVATED BY THE PRESENCE OF LARGE BIASES IN EXISTING PHASE DISCRIMINATION ALGORITHMS, WE DEVELOP A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR SINGLE-PARTICLE PHASE CLASSIFICATION OF BINARY 2D-S IMAGES USING A RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON ICE-LIQUID DISCRIMINATOR (UWILD). UWILD USES 14 PARAMETERS COMPUTED FROM BINARY IMAGE DATA, AS WELL AS PARTICLE INTER-ARRIVAL TIME, TO PREDICT PHASE. WE USE LIQUID-ONLY AND ICE-DOMINATED TIME PERIODS WITHIN THE SOCRATES DATASET AS TRAINING AND TESTING DATA. THIS NOVEL APPROACH TO MODEL TRAINING AVOIDS MAJOR PITFALLS ASSOCIATED WITH USING MANUALLY LABELED DATA, INCLUDING REDUCED MODEL GENERALIZABILITY AND HIGH LABOR COSTS. WE FIND THAT UWILD IS WELL CALIBRATED AND HAS AN OVERALL ACCURACY OF 95 % COMPARED TO 72 % AND 79 % FOR TWO EXISTING PHASE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS THAT WE COMPARE IT WITH. UWILD IMPROVES CLASSIFICATIONS OF SMALL ICE CRYSTALS AND LARGE LIQUID DROPS IN PARTICULAR AND HAS MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN THE OTHER ALGORITHMS TO IDENTIFY BOTH LIQUID-DOMINATED AND ICE-DOMINATED REGIONS WITHIN THE SOCRATES DATASET. UWILD MISCLASSIFIES A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF LARGE LIQUID DROPS AS ICE. SUCH MISCLASSIFIED PARTICLES ARE TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH MODEL CONFIDENCE BELOW 75 % AND CAN EASILY BE FILTERED OUT OF THE DATASET. UWILD PHASE CLASSIFICATIONS SHOW THAT PARTICLES WITH AREA-EQUIVALENT DIAMETER (DEQ) < 0.17 MM ARE MOSTLY LIQUID AT ALL TEMPERATURES SAMPLED, DOWN TO -40 °. LARGER PARTICLES (DEQ>0.17 MM) ARE PREDOMINANTLY FROZEN AT ALL TEMPERATURES BELOW 0 °. BETWEEN 0 AND 5 °, THERE ARE ROUGHLY EQUAL NUMBERS OF FROZEN AND LIQUID MID-SIZED PARTICLES (0.17<DEQ<0.33 MM), AND LARGER PARTICLES (DEQ>0.33 MM) ARE MOSTLY FROZEN.

ARAB J. OF INFO. TECH.,"RESEARCH ON FACE RECOGNITION HAS BEEN EVOLVING FOR DECADES. THERE ARE NUMEROUS APPROACHES DEVELOPED WITH HIGHLY DESIRABLE OUTCOMES IN CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENTS. IN CONTRAST, APPROACHES TO FACE RECOGNITION IN AN UNCONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT WHERE VARIED FACIAL POSING, OCCLUSION, AGING, AND IMAGE QUALITY STILL POSE VAST CHALLENGES. THUS, FACE RECOGNITION IN THE UNCONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT STILL AN UNRESOLVED PROBLEM. MANY CURRENT TECHNIQUES ARE NOT PERFORMED WELL WHEN EXPERIMENTED IN UNCONSTRAINED DATABASES. ADDITIONALLY, MOST OF THE REAL-WORLD APPLICATION NEEDS A GOOD FACE RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE IN THE UNCONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS AIMED TO ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF FACE RECOGNITION IN AN UNCONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IN AN UNCONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT. THE FUSION BETWEEN GABOR FILTERS AND MAXIMUM RESPONSE (MR) FILTERS WITH RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER IS IMPLEMENTED IN THE PROPOSED SYSTEM. GABOR FILTERS ARE A HYBRID OF GABOR MAGNITUDE FILTERS AND ORIENTED GABOR PHASE CONGRUENCY (OGPC) FILTERS. GABOR MAGNITUDE FILTERS PRODUCE THE MAGNITUDE RESPONSE WHILE THE OGPC FILTERS PRODUCE THE PHASE RESPONSE OF GABOR FILTERS. THE MR FILTERS CONTAIN THE EDGE-AND BAR-ANISOTROPIC FILTER RESPONSES AND ISOTROPIC FILTER RESPONSES. IN THE FACE FEATURES SELECTION PROCESS, MONTE CARLO UNINFORMATIVE VARIABLE ELIMINATION PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION (MC-UVE-PLSR) IS USED TO SELECT THE OPTIMAL FACE FEATURES IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE COMPUTATIONAL COSTS WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE ACCURACY OF FACE RECOGNITION. RANDOM FORESTS IS USED IN THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE GENERATED FEATURE VECTORS.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO INTRODUCE CLUSTER ANALYSIS, UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING METHOD, FOR CLASSIFICATION OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) MANDIBULAR CANAL (MC) COURSES, AND TO VISUALIZE STANDARD MC COURSES DERIVED FROM CLUSTER ANALYSIS IN THE KOREAN POPULATION. MATERIALS AND METHODS A TOTAL OF 429 CONE-BEAM COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IMAGES WERE USED. FOUR SITES IN THE MANDIBLE WERE SELECTED FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE MC COURSE AND FOUR PARAMETERS, TWO VERTICAL AND TWO HORIZONTAL PARAMETERS WERE MEASURED PER SITE. CLUSTER ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT AS FOLLOWS: PARAMETER MEASUREMENT, PARAMETER NORMALIZATION, CLUSTER TENDENCY EVALUATION, OPTIMAL NUMBER OF CLUSTERS DETERMINATION, AND K-MEANS CLUSTER ANALYSIS. THE 3D MC COURSES WERE CLASSIFIED INTO THREE TYPES WITH STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MEAN DIFFERENCES BY CLUSTER ANALYSIS. RESULTS CLUSTER 1 SHOWED A SMOOTH LINE RUNNING TOWARDS THE LINGUAL SIDE IN THE AXIAL VIEW AND A STEEP SLOPE IN THE SAGITTAL VIEW. CLUSTER 2 RAN IN AN ALMOST STRAIGHT LINE CLOSEST TO THE LINGUAL AND INFERIOR BORDER OF MANDIBLE. CLUSTER 3 SHOWED THE PATHWAY WITH A BENT BUCCALLY IN THE AXIAL VIEW AND AN INCREASING SLOPE IN THE SAGITTAL VIEW IN THE POSTERIOR AREA. CLUSTER 2 SHOWED THE HIGHEST DISTRIBUTION (42.1%), AND MALES WERE MORE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED (57.1%) THAN THE FEMALES (42.9%). CLUSTER 3 COMPRISED SIMILAR RATIO OF MALE AND FEMALE CASES AND ACCOUNTED FOR 31.9% OF THE TOTAL DISTRIBUTION. CLUSTER 1 HAD THE LEAST DISTRIBUTION (26.0%) DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDES DID NOT SHOW A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. CONCLUSION THE MC COURSES WERE AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFIED AS THREE TYPES THROUGH CLUSTER ANALYSIS.

THIS COULD POSE A THREAT TO THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND, IN SERIOUS CASES, TO THE ETHICS REGARDING THE SOCIALLY-WEAK ELDERLY. AN ANALYSIS OF THE BEHAVIORAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ELDERLY AND YOUNG ADULTS BASED ON THEIR PHYSICAL CONDITIONS ENABLES SILVER ROBOTS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMIZED SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY TO COUNTER AGING SOCIETY PROBLEMS, LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR IMPROVING ELDERLY WELFARE SYSTEMS AND AUTOMATING ELDERLY CARE SYSTEMS. ACCORDINGLY, SKELETON SEQUENCES MODELING THE CHANGES OF THE HUMAN BODY ARE CONVERTED INTO POSE EVOLUTION IMAGES (PEIS), AND A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) IS TRAINED TO CLASSIFY THE ELDERLY AND YOUNG ADULTS FOR A SINGLE BEHAVIOR. THEN, A HEATMAP, WHICH IS A CONTRIBUTED PORTION OF THE INPUTS, IS OBTAINED USING A GRADIENT-WEIGHTED CLASS ACTIVATION MAP (GRAD-CAM) FOR THE CLASSIFIED RESULTS, AND A SKELETONHEATMAP IS OBTAINED THROUGH A SERIES OF PROCESSES FOR THE EASE OF ANALYSIS.

HOWEVER, DEPENDENCY ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HERBICIDE PRACTICES HAS LED TO OVERUSE THROUGH CONTINUOUS GROWTH OF CROPS RESISTANT TO A SINGLE MODE OF ACTION. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A COST-EFFECTIVE WEED MANAGEMENT STRATEGY THAT DOES NOT PROMOTE GLYPHOSATE-RESISTANT WEED BIOTYPES, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RESISTANT AND SUSCEPTIBLE BIOTYPES HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED ACCURATELY IN THE FIELD CONDITIONS. UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV)-ASSISTED THERMAL AND MULTISPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING HAS POTENTIAL FOR DETECTING BIOPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF WEED BIOTYPES DURING THE GROWING SEASON, WHICH INCLUDES DISTINGUISHING GLYPHOSATE-SUSCEPTIBLE AND GLYPHOSATE-RESISTANT WEED POPULATIONS BASED ON CANOPY TEMPERATURE AND DEEP LEARNING DRIVEN WEED IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHMS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY HERBICIDE RESISTANCE AFTER GLYPHOSATE APPLICATION IN TRUE FIELD CONDITIONS BY ANALYZING THE UAV-ACQUIRED THERMAL AND MULTISPECTRAL RESPONSE OF KOCHIA, WATERHEMP, REDROOT PIGWEED, AND COMMON RAGWEED. THE DATA WERE PROCESSED IN ARCGIS FOR RASTER CLASSIFICATION AS WELL AS SPECTRAL COMPARISON OF GLYPHOSATE-RESISTANT AND GLYPHOSATE-SUSCEPTIBLE WEEDS. THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY BETWEEN THE SENSORS AND CLASSIFICATION METHODS OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD, RANDOM TREES, AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) WERE COMPARED. THE RANDOM TREES CLASSIFIER PERFORMED THE BEST AT 4 DAYS AFTER APPLICATION (DAA) FOR KOCHIA WITH 62.9% ACCURACY. THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD CLASSIFIER PROVIDED THE HIGHEST PERFORMING RESULT OUT OF ALL CLASSIFICATION METHODS WITH AN ACCURACY OF 75.2%. A COMMENDABLE CLASSIFICATION WAS MADE AT 8 DAA WHERE THE RANDOM TREES CLASSIFIER ATTAINED AN ACCURACY OF 87.2%. HOWEVER, THERMAL REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS AS A PREDICTOR FOR GLYPHOSATE RESISTANCE WITHIN WEED POPULATIONS IN FIELD CONDITION WAS UNRELIABLE DUE TO ITS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.

SCI. INSTRUM.,"THE QUALITY OF POLARIZATION IMAGES IS EASY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE NOISE IN THE IMAGE ACQUIRED BY A POLARIZATION CAMERA. CONSEQUENTLY, A DE-NOISING METHOD OPTIMIZED WITH A PULSE COUPLED NEURAL NETWORK (PCNN) FOR POLARIZATION IMAGES IS PROPOSED FOR A FIELD-PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAY (FPGA)-BASED POLARIZATION CAMERA IN THIS PAPER, IN WHICH THE POLARIZATION IMAGE DE-NOISING IS IMPLEMENTED USING AN ADAPTIVE PCNN IMPROVED BY GRAY WOLF OPTIMIZATION (GWO) AND BI-DIMENSIONAL EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION (BEMD). UNLIKE OTHER ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS, PCNN DOES NOT NEED TO BE TRAINED, BUT THE PARAMETERS OF PCNN SUCH AS THE EXPONENTIAL DECAY TIME CONSTANT, THE SYNAPTIC JUNCTION STRENGTH FACTOR, AND THE INHERENT VOLTAGE CONSTANT PLAY A CRITICAL INFLUENCE ON ITS DE-NOISING PERFORMANCE. GWO IS ABLE TO START OPTIMIZATION BY GENERATING A SET OF RANDOM SOLUTIONS AS THE FIRST POPULATION AND SAVES THE OPTIMIZED SOLUTIONS OF PCNN. IN ADDITION, BEMD CAN DECOMPOSE A COMPLICATED IMAGE INTO DIFFERENT BI-DIMENSIONAL INTRINSIC MODE FUNCTIONS WITH LOCAL STABILIZED CHARACTERISTICS ACCORDING TO THE INPUT SOURCE IMAGE, AND THE DECOMPOSITION RESULT IS ABLE TO LOWER THE COMPLEXITY OF HEAVY NOISE IMAGE ANALYSIS. MOREOVER, THE CIRCUIT IN THE POLARIZATION CAMERA IS ACCOMPLISHED BY FPGA SO AS TO OBTAIN THE POLARIZATION IMAGE WITH HIGHER QUALITY SYNCHRONOUSLY. THESE TWO SCHEMES ARE COMBINED TO ATTENUATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF NOISES AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE POLARIZATION IMAGE SIGNIFICANTLY. COMPARED WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IMAGE DE-NOISING ALGORITHMS, THE NOISE IN THE POLARIZATION IMAGE IS SUPPRESSED EFFECTIVELY BY THE PROPOSED OPTIMIZED IMAGE DE-NOISING METHOD ACCORDING TO THE INDICES OF PEAK SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO, STANDARD DEVIATION, MUTUAL INFORMATION, STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY, AND ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR. © 2021 AUTHOR(S).",113703,NA,RSINA,"ZHAO, D.; KEY LABORATORY OF INSTRUMENTATION SCIENCE AND DYNAMIC MEASUREMENT, CHINA; EMAIL: 20030836@NUC.EDU.CN",ARTICLE,10.1063/5.0056983,NA,52053018000T,NA,00346748,REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS,ENGLISH,CITED BY 0,11,NA,AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF PHYSICS INC.,34852566,SCOPUS,AN OPTIMIZED PULSE COUPLED NEURAL NETWORK IMAGE DE-NOISING METHOD FOR A FIELD-PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAY BASED POLARIZATION CAMERA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119370592&doi=10.1063%2f5.0056983&partnerID=40&md5=ce0e6b503e3e9f1a1079b3baac6c9251,92,2021,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED, IN PART, BY THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROJECT OF STATE GRID SHANXI ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY UNDER GRANT NO. 52053018000T.

ALTHOUGH EXISTING DEEP LEARNING-BASED FER APPROACHES HAVE BEEN QUITE PROMISING IN RECOGNIZING FRONTAL FACES, THEY STILL STRUGGLE TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ON THE FACES THAT ARE PARTLY OCCLUDED IN UNCONSTRAINED SCENARIOS. TO MITIGATE THIS ISSUE, WE PROPOSE A TRANSFORMER-BASED FER METHOD (TFE) THAT IS CAPABLE OF ADAPTATIVELY FOCUSING ON THE MOST IMPORTANT AND UNOCCLUDED FACIAL REGIONS. TFE IS BASED ON THE MULTI-HEAD SELF-ATTENTION MECHANISM THAT CAN FLEXIBLY ATTEND TO A SEQUENCE OF IMAGE PATCHES TO ENCODE THE CRITICAL CUES FOR FER. COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL TRANSFORMER, THE NOVELTY OF TFE IS TWO-FOLD: (I) TO EFFECTIVELY SELECT THE DISCRIMINATIVE FACIAL REGIONS, WE INTEGRATE ALL THE ATTENTION WEIGHTS IN VARIOUS TRANSFORMER LAYERS INTO AN ATTENTION MAP TO GUIDE THE NETWORK TO PERCEIVE THE IMPORTANT FACIAL REGIONS. (II) GIVEN AN INPUT OCCLUDED FACIAL IMAGE, WE USE A DECODER TO RECONSTRUCT THE CORRESPONDING NON-OCCLUDED FACE. THUS, TFE IS CAPABLE OF INFERRING THE OCCLUDED REGIONS TO BETTER RECOGNIZE THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. WE EVALUATE THE PROPOSED TFE ON THE TWO PREVALENT IN-THE-WILD FACIAL EXPRESSION DATASETS (AFFECTNET AND RAF-DB) AND THE THEIR MODIFICATIONS WITH ARTIFICIAL OCCLUSIONS. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT TFE IMPROVES THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY ON BOTH THE NON-OCCLUDED FACES AND OCCLUDED FACES.

HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THE 2D-TO-3D AMBIGUITIES EXISTED IN THESE WEAK SUPERVISION LABELS, THE NETWORK IS EASY TO GET STUCK IN LOCAL OPTIMA WHEN TRAINED WITH SUCH LABELS. IN THIS PAPER, WE REDUCE THE AMBITUITY BY OPTIMIZING MULTIPLE INITIALIZATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE A THREE-STAGE FRAMEWORK NAMED MULTI-INITIALIZATION OPTIMIZATION NETWORK (MION).

THE CS-FORMER CONSISTS OF FIVE CONVOLUTION BLOCKS AND N SPATIAL ENCODERS, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO GUIDE THE NETWORK TO LEARN OCCLUSION AND POSE-ROBUST FACIAL FEATURES FROM THE SPATIAL PERSPECTIVE. AND THE TEMPORAL TRANSFORMER CONSISTS OF M TEMPORAL ENCODERS, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW THE NETWORK TO LEARN CONTEXTUAL FACIAL FEATURES FROM THE TEMPORAL PERSPECTIVE. THE HEATMAPS OF THE LEANED FACIAL FEATURES DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROPOSED FORMER-DFER IS CAPABLE OF HANDLING THE ISSUES SUCH AS OCCLUSION, NON-FRONTAL POSE, AND HEAD MOTION. AND THE VISUALIZATION OF THE FEATURE DISTRIBUTION SHOWS THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD CAN LEARN MORE DISCRIMINATIVE FACIAL FEATURES. MOREOVER, OUR FORMER-DFER ALSO ACHIEVES STATE-OF-THE-ART RESULTS ON THE DFEW AND AFEW BENCHMARKS. © 2021 ACM.",NA,DEEP LEARNING; DYNAMIC FACIAL EXPRESSION; IN-THE-WILD FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; SPATIO-TEMPORAL TRANSFORMER,NA,"LIU, Q.; ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER OF DIGITAL FORENSICS, EMAIL: QSLIU@NUIST.EDU.CN",CONFERENCE PAPER,10.1145/3474085.3475292,NA,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA, NSFC, 61825601 NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF JIANGSU PROVINCENATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF JIANGSU PROVINCE, BK20192004B",9781450386517,NA,MM 2021 - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 29TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MULTIMEDIA,ENGLISH,CITED BY 5,NA,1553-1561,"ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY, INC",NA,SCOPUS,FORMER-DFER: DYNAMIC FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION TRANSFORMER,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115830102&doi=10.1145%2f3474085.3475292&partnerID=40&md5=fb8800e8b3f366f97dcdac417fc24e6c,NA,2021,THIS WORK IS SUPPORTED IN PART BY THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (NSFC) UNDER GRANT 61825601 AND IN PART BY THE NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF JIANGSU PROVINCE (NSF-JS) UNDER GRANT BK20192004B.

BIOM. BEHAV. IDEN. SCI.,"IN LIGHT OF THE RISING DEMAND FOR BIOMETRIC-AUTHENTICATION SYSTEMS, PREVENTING FACE SPOOFING ATTACKS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR THE SAFE DEPLOYMENT OF FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS. HERE, WE PROPOSE AN EFFICIENT FACE PRESENTATION ATTACK DETECTION (PAD) ALGORITHM THAT REQUIRES MINIMAL HARDWARE AND ONLY A SMALL DATABASE, MAKING IT SUITABLE FOR RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED DEVICES SUCH AS MOBILE PHONES. UTILIZING ONE MONOCULAR VISIBLE-LIGHT CAMERA, THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM TAKES TWO FACIAL PHOTOS, TAKEN WITH AND WITHOUT A FLASH, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROPOSED SPECDIFF DESCRIPTOR IS CONSTRUCTED BY LEVERAGING TWO TYPES OF REFLECTION: (I) SPECULAR REFLECTIONS FROM THE IRIS REGION THAT HAVE A SPECIFIC INTENSITY DISTRIBUTION DEPENDING ON LIVENESS, AND (II) DIFFUSE REFLECTIONS FROM THE ENTIRE FACE REGION THAT REPRESENTS THE 3D STRUCTURE OF A SUBJECT'S FACE. CLASSIFIERS TRAINED WITH THE SPECDIFF DESCRIPTOR OUTPERFORM OTHER FLASH-BASED PAD ALGORITHMS ON BOTH AN IN-HOUSE DATABASE AND FOUR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASES: NUAA, REPLAY-ATTACK, SPOOFING IN THE WILD, AND OULU-NPU. FURTHERMORE, THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM ACHIEVES STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER ACCURACY TO THAT OF AN END-TO-END, DEEP NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIER, WHILE BEING APPROXIMATELY SIX-TIMES FASTER EXECUTION SPEED. THE LIMITATION OF THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM IS ALSO QUANTIFIED UNDER VARIOUS ADVERSARIAL LIGHTING CONDITIONS, TO GUIDE USERS FOR THE SAFE DEPLOYMENT OF THE ALGORITHM.

THESE ESTIMATES MAY BE INACCURATE IF CCVA IS TRAINED ON NON-LOCAL TRAINING DATA DIFFERENT FROM THE LOCAL POPULATION OF INTEREST. THIS PROBLEM IS A SPECIAL CASE OF TRANSFER LEARNING, I.E., IMPROVING CLASSIFICATION WITHIN A TARGET DOMAIN (E.G., A PARTICULAR POPULATION) WITH THE CLASSIFIER TRAINED IN A SOURCE-DOMAIN. MOST TRANSFER LEARNING APPROACHES CONCERN INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL (E.G., A PERSON'S) CLASSIFICATION. SOCIAL AND HEALTH SCIENTISTS SUCH AS EPIDEMIOLOGISTS ARE OFTEN MORE INTERESTED WITH UNDERSTANDING ETIOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTIONS AT THE POPULATION-LEVEL. THE SAMPLE SIZES OF THEIR DATA SETS ARE TYPICALLY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER THAN THOSE USED FOR COMMON TRANSFER LEARNING APPLICATIONS LIKE IMAGE CLASSIFICATION, DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION, ETC. WE PRESENT A PARSIMONIOUS HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN TRANSFER LEARNING FRAMEWORK TO DIRECTLY ESTIMATE POPULATION-LEVEL CLASS PROBABILITIES IN A TARGET DOMAIN, USING ANY BASELINE CLASSIFIER TRAINED ON SOURCE-DOMAIN, AND A SMALL LABELED TARGET-DOMAIN DATASET. TO ADDRESS SMALL SAMPLE SIZES, WE INTRODUCE A NOVEL SHRINKAGE PRIOR FOR THE TRANSFER ERROR RATES GUARANTEEING THAT, IN ABSENCE OF ANY LABELED TARGET-DOMAIN DATA OR WHEN THE BASELINE CLASSIFIER IS PERFECTLY ACCURATE, OUR TRANSFER LEARNING AGREES WITH DIRECT AGGREGATION OF PREDICTIONS FROM THE BASELINE CLASSIFIER, THEREBY SUBSUMING THE DEFAULT PRACTICE AS A SPECIAL CASE. WE THEN EXTEND OUR APPROACH TO USE AN ENSEMBLE OF BASELINE CLASSIFIERS PRODUCING AN UNIFIED ESTIMATE.

AN AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION METHOD OF SNOW LEOPARD MONITORING IMAGES BASED ON DEEP LEARNING DATA EXPANSION WAS PROPOSED TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF THE SNOW LEOPARD UNDER LIMITED SAMPLES. METHOD: IMPROVING THE RESNEST50 MODEL WITH ATTENTION MECHANISM, THE SNOW LEOPARD MONITORING IMAGES OF QILIAN MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK OF NORTHWESTERN CHINA WERE USED AS THE ORIGINAL DATASET, THE NON-SNOW LEOPARD TERRESTRIAL WILDLIFE IMAGES TAKEN BY THE INFRARED TRIGGER CAMERA WERE USED AS THE EXTENDED NEGATIVE SAMPLE, AND THE NETWORK SNOW LEOPARD IMAGES WERE USED AS THE EXTENDED POSITIVE SAMPLE. COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED IN TURN BASED ON THE ABOVE THREE DATASETS. THE MODEL WAS GRADUALLY GUIDED TO FOCUS ON THE KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUAL SNOW LEOPARDS BY CHOOSING AN APPROPRIATE EXPANSION METHOD, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DATA EXPANSION WAS VERIFIED BY GRADIENT-WEIGHTED CLASS ACTIVATION MAP. RESULT: THE MODEL TRAINED WITH THE ORIGINAL DATA SET+EXPANDED NEGATIVE SAMPLES+EXPANDED POSITIVE SAMPLES HAD THE BEST RECOGNITION EFFECT. THE GRAD-CAM SHOWED THAT THE MODEL CORRECTLY FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUAL PATTERN AND SPOT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SNOW LEOPARD. COMPARED WITH THE RECOGNITION MODEL BASED ON VGG16 AND RESNET50, RESNEST50 ACHIEVED THE BEST RECOGNITION EFFECT, THE TEST SET RECOGNITION ACCURACY RATE REACHED 97.70%, THE PRECISION RATE REACHED 97.26%, AND THE RECALL RATE REACHED 97.59%. CONCLUSION: THE MODEL TRAINED BY THE ORIGINAL DATA SET+EXTENDED NEGATIVE SAMPLE+EXTENDED POSITIVE SAMPLE DATA EXPANSION METHOD PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER CAN DISTINGUISH THE BACKGROUND FROM THE FOREGROUND, AND HAS A STRONG ABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SNOW LEOPARD ITSELF, AND THE GENERALIZATION ABILITY IS THE BEST. © 2021, EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT OF JOURNAL OF BEIJING FORESTRY UNIVERSITY.

THESE ORGANISMS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS INDICATORS OF WATER ECOSYSTEM CONDITIONS SINCE THEY REACT QUICKLY AND PREDICTABLY TO A BROAD RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS, THUS PROVIDING EARLY SIGNALS OF DANGEROUS CHANGES. TRADITIONALLY, MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS HAS BEEN USED TO IDENTIFY AND ENUMERATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANISMS PRESENT WITHIN A GIVEN ENVIRONMENT AT A GIVEN POINT IN TIME. HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH IS BOTH TIME-CONSUMING AND LABOR INTENSIVE, AS IT RELIES ON MANUAL PROCESSING AND CLASSIFICATION OF PLANKTONIC ORGANISMS PRESENT WITHIN COLLECTED WATER SAMPLES. FURTHERMORE, IT REQUIRES HIGHLY SKILLED SPECIALISTS TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE AND DISTINGUISH ONE TAXA FROM ANOTHER ON THE BASIS OF OFTEN SUBTLE MORPHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES.

GENERALLY, GROUND CHECKING IS MORE ACCURATE THAN ANY OTHER METHODS. HOWEVER, THE SURVIVAL RATE OF SEEDLINGS CAN BE HIGHER IN THE GROWING SEASON, AND THIS CAN BE ESTIMATED IN A LARGER AREA AT A RELATIVELY LOWER COST BY EXTRACTING THE TREE CROWN FROM THE UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV) IMAGES, WHICH PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MONITORING AFFORESTATION IN AN EXTENSIVE AREA. AT PRESENT, STUDIES ON EXTRACTING INDIVIDUAL TREE CROWNS UNDER THE COMPLEX GROUND VEGETATION CONDITIONS ARE LIMITED. BASED ON THE AFFORESTATION IMAGES OBTAINED BY AIRBORNE CONSUMER-GRADE CAMERAS IN CENTRAL CHINA, THIS STUDY PROPOSES A METHOD OF EXTRACTING AND FUSING MULTIPLE RADII MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES TO OBTAIN THE POTENTIAL CROWN. A RANDOM FOREST (RF) WAS USED TO IDENTIFY THE REGIONS EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGES, AND THEN THE RECOGNIZED CROWN REGIONS WERE FUSED SELECTIVELY ACCORDING TO THE DISTANCE. A LOW-COST INDIVIDUAL CROWN RECOGNITION FRAMEWORK WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR RAPID CHECKING OF PLANTED TREES. THE METHOD WAS TESTED IN TWO AFFORESTATION AREAS OF 5950 M2 AND 5840 M2, WITH A POPULATION OF 2418 TREES (KOELREUTERIA) IN TOTAL. DUE TO THE COMPLEX TERRAIN OF THE SAMPLE PLOT, HIGH WEED COVERAGE, THE CROWN WIDTH OF TREES, AND SPACING OF SAPLINGS VARY GREATLY, WHICH INCREASES BOTH THE DIFFICULTY AND COMPLEXITY OF CROWN EXTRACTION.

AGRIC.,"POSTURE AND THE RATE OF POSTURAL CHANGES OF FARROWING AND LACTATING SOWS ARE CONSIDERED RELIABLE INDICATORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMFORT AND HEALTH STATUS AND ARE RISK FACTORS FOR PIGLET CRUSHING. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A COMBINED DEEP LEARNING AND PRINCIPLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) BASED APPROACH TO CLASSIFY DIFFERENT POSTURAL BEHAVIOURS OF SOWS IN VIDEOS. COMPARED TO PREVIOUS STUDIES OF SOW'S POSTURAL BEHAVIOUR CLASSIFICATION BASED ON DEEP LEARNING, THIS STUDY SELECTS SEQUENCES OF FRAMES FROM THE VIDEOS THAT DISTINGUISH DIFFERENT POSTURAL BEHAVIOURS RATHER THAN USING ALL FRAMES FOR THE CLASSIFICATION. VIDEOS WERE COLLECTED FROM 13 SOWS, AND THE RECORDING STARTED FROM 5 DAYS BEFORE THE EXPECTED DATE OF FARROWING UNTIL WEANING. FROM THE VIDEOS, 3100 VIDEOS WITHOUT PIGLETS AND 1680 INCLUDING PIGLETS WERE MANUALLY SELECTED. THEN, THESE VIDEOS WERE AUGMENTED BY USING VERTICAL MIRRORING AND ADDING GAUSSIAN NOISE, WHICH RESULTED IN 7200 AND 4600 VIDEOS WITHOUT AND INCLUDING PIGLETS, RESPECTIVELY. EACH VIDEO LASTED 5 SEC AND INCLUDED 1 OUT OF 5 BEHAVIOURAL POSTURES (STERNAL LYING, LATERAL LYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING) LABELLED BY ONE TRAINED EXPERT WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN SOW'S BEHAVIOUR CLASSIFICATION. OUT OF THE TOTAL OF 11,800 VIDEOS, 75% WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED AS TRAINING SET AND THE REMAINING 25% AS VALIDATION SET. TO SELECT MOTION-RELATED FRAMES, EACH VIDEO WAS FIRST CONVERTED INTO A MULTIDIMENSIONAL MATRIX. THEN, PCA WAS PERFORMED ON THE MATRIX AND A NUMBER OF COMPONENT(S) WERE SELECTED TO REPRESENT THE FRAME. AFTER THAT, THE FRAME EUCLIDEAN DISTANCES WERE COMPUTED BASED ON THE COMPONENTS AND THE FRAMES OVER A CERTAIN DISTANCE THRESHOLD WERE SELECTED TO GENERATE NEW VIDEOS. SINCE A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF COMPONENTS AND DISTANCE THRESHOLDS CAN AFFECT THE NUMBER OF SELECTED FRAMES, A RANGE OF COMPONENT NUMBERS (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50) AND DISTANCE THRESHOLDS WERE FURTHER TESTED TO FIND THE OPTIMAL PARAMETERS. THE BEST BALANCE BETWEEN ACCURACY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE CLASSIFICATION WAS OBTAINED WHEN USING 10 COMPONENTS (87.98% OF TOTAL VARIATION). THE BEST RESULTS WERE OBTAINED WHEN THE THRESHOLD WAS SET AS ONE FOURTH OF THE LARGEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO SUCCESSIVE FRAMES. TO CLASSIFY DIFFERENT BEHAVIOURS, THE VIDEOS COMPOSED OF THE SELECTED FRAMES WERE TRAINED AND VALIDATED WITH CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) AND A LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) MODELS. USING THE PROPOSED METHOD, POSTURAL BEHAVIOURS COULD BE CLASSIFIED WITH ACCURACIES OF 95.33% AND 92.67% ON VIDEOS WITHOUT PIGLETS AND ALL DATA (INCLUDING AND NOT INCLUDING PIGLETS). FURTHERMORE, 500 NEW VIDEOS WERE SELECTED FROM THE EXPERIMENT AND WERE USED AS TEST SET. THE FINAL MODEL WAS FURTHER TESTED ON THE TEST SET AND RETURNED AN ACCURACY OF 90.60%, WHICH INDICATED THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD CAN BE GENERALIZED ON NEW DATA. © 2021 ELSEVIER B.V.",106351,BEHAVIOUR CLASSIFICATION; FRAME SELECTION; PCA; PIG; VIDEO ANALYSIS; WELFARE,CEAGE,"NORTON, T.; FACULTY OF BIOSCIENCE ENGINEERING, KASTEELPARK ARENBERG 30, BELGIUM; EMAIL: TOMAS.NORTON@KULEUVEN.BE",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.compag.2021.106351,NA,NA,NA,01681699,COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE,ENGLISH,CITED BY 12,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,A PCA-BASED FRAME SELECTION METHOD FOR APPLYING CNN AND LSTM TO CLASSIFY POSTURAL BEHAVIOUR IN SOWS,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112508167&doi=10.1016%2fj.compag.2021.106351&partnerID=40&md5=c370ef3250527e5c66fedf13294499e8,189,2021,"NA NA NA","FACULTY OF BIOSCIENCE ENGINEERING, KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN (KU LEUVEN), KASTEELPARK ARENBERG 30, HEVERLEE/LEUVEN, 3001, BELGIUM; INSTITUTE OF ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE (ITT), UNIVERSITY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE (VETMEDUNI) VIENNA, VETERINAERPLATZ1, VIENNA, A-1210, AUSTRIA; PRECISION LIVESTOCK FARMING HUB, THE UNIVERSITY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE VIENNA (VETMEDUNI VIENNA), VETERINÄRPLATZ 1, VIENNA, 1210, AUSTRIA",ISI,0,none,KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN (KU LEUVEN);UNIVERSITY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE (VETMEDUNI) VIENNA;THE UNIVERSITY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE VIENNA (VETMEDUNI VIENNA),KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN (KU LEUVEN);UNIVERSITY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE (VETMEDUNI) VIENNA;THE UNIVERSITY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE VIENNA (VETMEDUNI VIENNA),NA,"WANG M, 2021, ","WANG M, 2021, "

IN THIS PAPER, A NOVEL MULTILEVEL THRESHOLDING ALGORITHM BASED ON CUCKOO SEARCH (CS) IS INTRODUCED. ONE OF THE MAJOR DRAWBACKS OF METAHEURISTIC ALGORITHMS IS THE STAGNATION PHENOMENON WHICH LEADS TO A FALL INTO LOCAL OPTIMUMS AND PREMATURE CONVERGENCE. TO OVERCOME THIS SHORTCOMING, THE IDEA OF DARWINIAN THEORY IS INCORPORATED WITH CS ALGORITHM TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY AND QUALITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT DECREASING THE CONVERGENCE SPEED OF CS ALGORITHM. A POLICY OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND PUNISHMENT IS CONSIDERED TO LEAD SEARCHING AGENTS IN THE SEARCH SPACE AND REDUCE THE COMPUTATIONAL TIME. THE ALGORITHM IS IMPLEMENTED BASED ON DIVIDING THE POPULATION INTO SPECIFIED GROUPS AND EACH GROUP TRIES TO FIND A BETTER LOCATION. TEN TEST IMAGES ARE SELECTED TO VERIFY THE ABILITY OF OUR ALGORITHM USING THE FAMOUS ENERGY CURVE METHOD. TWO POPULAR ENTROPIES CRITERIA, OTSU AND KAPUR, ARE EMPLOYED TO EVALUATE THE CAPABILITY OF THE INTRODUCED ALGORITHM.

TO CONTROL THE MICROCAPSULE PREPARATION OR OBTAIN AN OPTIMAL PREPARATION CONDITION, THE MECHANISM OF THE MICROCAPSULE PREPARATION SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED. THE MECHANISM IS ESTIMATED VIA STRUCTURE REFORMATION DURING THE PREPARATION PROCESS BECAUSE DIAMETER AND WALL THICKNESS ARE DRASTICALLY ALTERED IN THE SOLUTION. CONSIDERING MICROCAPSULE APPLICATIONS, SOME IMPORTANT PROPERTIES, SUCH AS THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF MICROCAPSULES AND RELEASE RATE OF THE ENCAPSULATED PRODUCT, DEPEND ON THE MICROCAPSULE STRUCTURE. IN THIS STUDY, POLYSTYRENE MICROCAPSULES CONTAINING SALINE WATER DROPLETS WERE PREPARED VIA THE SOLVENT EVAPORATION METHOD FROM A SOLID-IN-OIL-IN-WATER (S/O/W) EMULSION SYSTEM. THE MICROCAPSULES EXHIBITED A SPECIFIC STRUCTURAL DISTRIBUTION, WHICH COMPRISED MONOCORE, MULTICORE, AND SOLIDCORE STRUCTURES. THE STRUCTURAL DISTRIBUTION WAS ALTERED BY THE PREPARATION CONDITION. THE MONOCORE STRUCTURE WAS ABSOLUTELY DOMINANT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF CALCIUM CHLORIDE ADDED IN THE ORGANIC PHASE. THE SALT CONCENTRATION IS NOT THE SOLE CONTROLLING FACTOR OF THE MICROCAPSULE STRUCTURE, AS THE SURFACTANT AND DISPERSION EXERTED A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE MICROCAPSULE STRUCTURE. THE STRUCTURAL DISTRIBUTION WAS AUTOMATICALLY ANALYZED BY A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM (MLA). THE DECISION-MAKING TIME FOR THE MICROCAPSULES PREPARATION WAS SHORTENED BY THE ACCELERATED STRUCTURE DETERMINATION, AND THE ACCURACY WAS IMPROVED BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COUNTING PARTICLES.

TO TRAIN THE UNET MODEL, IMAGES AND CORRESPONDING MASKS ARE USED AS THE TRAINING DATA. DIFFERENT OPTIMIZERS ARE APPLIED TO EACH MODEL. DURING INFERENCE, UNET OUTPUTS A BINARY MASK WITH ONES WHERE AN ANIMAL IS DETECTED AND ZEROS ELSEWHERE. SQUEEZENET MODEL IS TRAINED WITH IMAGES CORRESPONDING TO SIX CLASSES: BUSHBUCK, IMPALA, LLAMA, WARTHOG, WATERBUCK, AND ZEBRA. THREE VARIANTS OF THE SQUEEZENET MODEL HAVE BEEN TRAINED. THE FIRST CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL BACKBONE WHILE THE OTHER TWO HAVE THE ORIGINAL BACKBONE WITH AN ADDITIONAL FIRE MODULE. IN ONE MODEL THE FIRE MODULE IS SIMILAR TO THE FIRE MODULES OF THE ORIGINAL BACKBONE WHILE IN THE OTHER MODEL, THE EXTRA FIRE MODULE CONTAINS BATCH NORMALIZATION LAYERS.

FIRST, A MULTI-ENCODER GENERATOR AND A FEATURE FUSION STRATEGY ARE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED IN THE MFJNN TO REALISE THE JOINT NORMALISATION OF MULTIPLE FACTORS IN ADDITION TO POSE. SECOND, A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK-BASED (CNN-BASED) NETWORK IS APPLIED IN THE MFJNN, WHICH ALLOWS THE MFJNN TO SIMULTANEOUSLY REALISE IMAGE SYNTHESIS AND FACIAL REPRESENTATION LEARNING. MOREOVER, AN IDENTITY PERCEPTIVE LOSS IS INTRODUCED BASED ON THE CNN-BASED NETWORK TO PRODUCE RELIABLE IDENTITY-PRESERVING FEATURES OF THE INPUT FACE IMAGES. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD CAN SYNTHESISE MULTI-FACTOR NORMALISATION RESULTS WITH IDENTITY PRESERVATION AND EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE FACE RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

SEVERAL OTHER EARLY FLOOD WARNING SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BUT THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY OUTDATED AND DID NOT ALERT THE USER IN REAL-TIME. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN IOT-BASED FLASH FLOOD DETECTION AND ALERT USING TENSORFLOW. THE FLASH FLOOD IS DETECTED BY USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE AND AN ALERT WILL BE SENT TO THE USER USING TELEGRAM. THE DETECTION DID NOT RELY ON A CONVENTIONAL WATER SENSOR TO DETECT FLOODS, INSTEAD, IT USES A VIDEO CAMERA TO MONITOR THE WATER LEVEL. MOREOVER, THE SYSTEM WAS IMPLEMENTED IN LOW-POWERED RASPBERRY PI WHICH CAN BE DEPLOYED TO MANY FLOODS PRONE AREAS. BASED ON THE TEST RESULT, THE SYSTEM CAN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN NORMAL AND FLASH FLOOD WATER LEVELS AND ALERT USERS VIA TELEGRAM CHANNEL.

THEREFORE, ACCURATE CROWD COUNTING AND DENSITY DISTRIBUTION ESTIMATION PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MANY SITUATIONS ESPECIALLY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WHICH HAS BEEN SPREADING AROUND THE WORLD. ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, IT REMAINS TO BE A CHALLENGING TASK BECAUSE OF THE VIVID INTRA-SCENE SCALE VARIATIONS OF PEOPLE CAUSED BY DEPTH EFFECTS.

TO ALLOW THE NETWORK TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF DEPTH WHEN ESTIMATING CROWD DENSITY, WE FIRST PROPOSE TO EMBED THIS INFORMATION INTO THE CROWD DENSITY ESTIMATION NETWORK INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE TRAINING PROCESS BY MEAN OF MULTI-TASK LEARNING. OUR NETWORK IS NOW DESIGNED TO SOLVE NOT ONLY THE MAIN TASK OF ESTIMATING CROWD DENSITY, BUT ALSO A SIDE TASK: DEPTH ESTIMATION. BESIDES, TO LEARN THE LARGE-SCALE FEATURES DIRECTLY, DENSE DILATED CONVOLUTION BLOCKS WERE PROPOSED TO BE USED IN OUR ENCODER. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT BY USING BOTH SUCH DIRECT AND INDIRECT METHODS, WE CAN BOOST THE PERFORMANCE AND ACHIEVE GOOD RESULTS COMPARED TO EXISTING METHODS.

TRADITIONALLY, CONSERVATIONISTS HAVE IDENTIFIED SPECIES BY EAR; HOWEVER, IT IS NOW COMMON TO DEPLOY AUDIO RECORDING TECHNOLOGY TO MONITOR ANIMAL AND ECOSYSTEM SOUNDS. ANIMALS USE SOUND FOR COMMUNICATION, MATING, NAVIGATION AND TERRITORIAL DEFENCE. ANIMAL SOUNDS PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION AND HELP CONSERVATIONISTS TO QUANTIFY BIODIVERSITY. ACOUSTIC MONITORING HAS GROWN IN POPULARITY DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF DIVERSE SENSOR TYPES WHICH INCLUDE CAMERA TRAPS, PORTABLE ACOUSTIC SENSORS, PASSIVE ACOUSTIC SENSORS, AND EVEN SMARTPHONES. PASSIVE ACOUSTIC SENSORS ARE EASY TO DEPLOY AND CAN BE LEFT RUNNING FOR LONG DURATIONS TO PROVIDE INSIGHTS ON HABITAT AND THE SOUNDS MADE BY ANIMALS AND ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. WHILE THIS TECHNOLOGY BRINGS ENORMOUS BENEFITS, THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT IS GENERATED MAKES PROCESSING A TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS FOR CONSERVATIONISTS. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS INTEREST AMONG CONSERVATIONISTS TO AUTOMATICALLY PROCESS ACOUSTIC DATA TO HELP SPEED UP BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENTS. PROCESSING THESE LARGE DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTING RELEVANT SOUNDS FROM BACKGROUND NOISE INTRODUCES SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES.

IMAGE AND GRAPHICS,"OBJECTIVE: THE RECOGNITION OF MULTI-PERSON INTERACTION BEHAVIOR HAS WIDE APPLICATIONS IN REAL LIFE. AT PRESENT, HUMAN ACTIVITY ANALYSIS RESEARCH MAINLY FOCUSES ON CLASSIFYING VIDEO CLIPS OF BEHAVIORS OF INDIVIDUAL PERSONS, BUT THE PROBLEM OF UNDERSTANDING COMPLEX HUMAN ACTIVITIES WITH RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED. WHEN PERFORMING MULTI-PERSON BEHAVIOR RECOGNITION, THE BODY INFORMATION IS MORE ABUNDANT AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TWO-PERSON ACTION FEATURES ARE MORE COMPLEX. THE PROBLEMS SUCH AS COMPLEX RECOGNITION METHODS AND LOW RECOGNITION ACCURACY OCCUR EASILY. WHEN THE RECOGNITION OBJECT CHANGES FROM A SINGLE PERSON TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE, WE NOT ONLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE ACTION INFORMATION OF EACH PERSON BUT ALSO NEED TO NOTICE THE INTERACTION INFORMATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS. AT PRESENT, THE INTERACTION INFORMATION OF MULTIPLE PEOPLE CANNOT BE EXTRACTED WELL. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM EFFECTIVELY, WE PROPOSE A MULTI-PERSON INTERACTION BEHAVIOR-RECOGNITION ALGORITHM BASED ON SKELETON GRAPH CONVOLUTION.METHOD: THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS METHOD IS THAT IT CAN FULLY UTILIZE THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DEPENDENCE INFORMATION BETWEEN HUMAN JOINTS. WE DESIGN THE INTERACTION INFORMATION BETWEEN SKELETONS TO DISCOVER THE POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AND DIFFERENT KEY POINTS. BY CAPTURING THE ADDITIONAL INTERACTION INFORMATION, WE CAN IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF ACTION RECOGNITION. CONSIDERING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MULTI-PERSON INTERACTION BEHAVIOR, THIS STUDY PROPOSES A SPATIO-TEMPORAL GRAPH CONVOLUTION MODEL BASED ON SKELETON. IN TERMS OF SPACE, WE HAVE VARIOUS DESIGNS FOR SINGLE-PERSON AND MULTI-PERSON CONNECTIONS. WE DESIGN THE SINGLE-PERSON CONNECTION WITHIN EACH FRAME. APART FROM THE PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE POINTS OF THE BODY, SOME POTENTIAL CORRELATIONS ARE ALSO ADDED BETWEEN JOINTS THAT REPRESENT NON-PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS SUCH AS THE LEFT AND RIGHT HANDS OF A SINGLE PERSON. WE DESIGN THE INTERACTION CONNECTION BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WITHIN EACH FRAME. WE USE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE TO MEASURE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN INTERACTION NODES AND DETERMINE WHICH POINTS BETWEEN THE TWO PERSONS HAVE A CERTAIN CONNECTION. THROUGH THIS METHOD, THE CONNECTION OF THE KEY POINTS BETWEEN THE TWO PERSONS IN THE FRAME NOT ONLY CAN ADD NEW AND NECESSARY INTERACTION CONNECTIONS, WHICH CAN BE USED AS A BRIDGE TO DESCRIBE THE INTERACTION INFORMATION OF THE TWO PERSONS' ACTIONS, BUT CAN ALSO PREVENT NOISE CONNECTIONS AND CAUSE THE UNDERLYING GRAPH TO HAVE A CERTAIN SPARSENESS. IN THE TIME DIMENSION, WE SEGMENT THE ACTION SEQUENCE. EVERY THREE FRAMES OF ACTION ARE USED AS A PROCESSING UNIT. WE DESIGN THE JOINTS BETWEEN THREE ADJACENT FRAMES, AND USE MORE ADJACENT JOINTS TO EXPAND THE RECEPTIVE FIELD TO HELP US LEARN THE CHANGE INFORMATION IN THE TIME DOMAIN. THROUGH THE MODELING DESIGN IN THE TIME AND SPACE DIMENSIONS, WE HAVE OBTAINED A COMPLEX ACTION SKELETON DIAGRAM. WE USE THE GENERALIZED GRAPH CONVOLUTION MODEL TO EXTRACT AND SUMMARIZE THE TWO PEOPLE ACTION FEATURES, AND APPROXIMATE HIGH-ORDER FAST CHEBYSHEV POLYNOMIALS OF SPECTRAL GRAPH CONVOLUTION TO OBTAIN HIGH-LEVEL FEATURE MAPS. AT THE SAME TIME, TO ENHANCE THE EXTRACTION OF TIME DOMAIN INFORMATION, WE PROPOSE THE APPLICATION OF SLICED RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK(RNN) TO VIDEO ACTION RECOGNITION TO ENHANCE THE CHARACTERIZATION OF TWO PEOPLE ACTIONS. BY DIVIDING THE INPUT SEQUENCE INTO MULTIPLE EQUILING SUBSEQUENCES AND USING A SEPARATE RNN NETWORK FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION ON EACH SUBSEQUENCE, WE CAN CALCULATE EACH SUBSEQUENCE AT THE SAME TIME, THEREBY OVERCOMING THE LIMITATIONS OF SLICED RNN THAT CANNOT BE PARALLELIZED. THROUGH THE INFORMATION TRANSFER BETWEEN LAYERS, THE LOCAL INFORMATION ON THE SUBSEQUENCE CAN BE INTEGRATED IN THE HIGH-LEVEL NETWORK, WHICH CAN INTEGRATE AND SUMMARIZE THE INFORMATION FROM LOCAL TO GLOBAL, AND THE NETWORK CAN CAPTURE THE ENTIRE ACTION-SEQUENCE DEPENDENT INFORMATION. FOR THE LOSS OF INFORMATION AT THE SLICE, WE HAVE SOLVED THIS PROBLEM BY TAKING THE THREE FRAME ACTIONS AS A PROCESSING UNIT.RESULT: THIS STUDY VALIDATES THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM ON TWO DATASETS (UT-INTERACTION AND SBU) AND COMPARES THEM WITH OTHER ADVANCED INTERACTION-RECOGNITION METHODS. THE UT-INTERACTION DATASET CONTAINS SIX CLASSES OF ACTIONS AND THE SBU INTERACTION DATASET HAS EIGHT CLASSES OF ACTIONS. WE USE 10-FOLD AND 5-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION FOR EVALUATION. IN THE UT-INTERACTION DATASET, COMPARED WITH H-LSTCM(CHIERARCHICAL LONG-SHORT-TERM CONCURRENT MEMORY) AND OTHER METHODS, THE PERFORMANCE IMPROVES BY 0.7% BASED ON THE SECOND-BEST ALGORITHM. IN THE SBU DATASET, COMPARED WITH GCNCONV, ROTCLIPS+MTCNN, SGCCONV, AND OTHER METHODS, THE ALGORITHM HAS BEEN IMPROVED BY 5.2%, 1.03%, AND 1.2% RESPECTIVELY. AT THE SAME TIME, FUSION EXPERIMENTS ARE CONDUCTED IN THE SBU DATASET TO VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS CONNECTIONS AND SLICED RNN. THIS METHOD CAN EFFECTIVELY EXTRACT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON INTERACTIONS, AND HAS A GOOD EFFECT ON THE RECOGNITION OF INTERACTION ACTIONS. CONCLUSION: IN THIS PAPER, THE INTERACTIVE RECOGNITION METHOD OF FUSION SPATIO-TEMPORAL GRAPH CONVOLUTION HAS HIGH ACCURACY FOR THE RECOGNITION OF INTERACTIVE ACTIONS, AND IT IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO THE RECOGNITION OF BEHAVIORS THAT GENERATE INTERACTION BETWEEN OBJECTS. © 2021, EDITORIAL AND PUBLISHING BOARD OF JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND GRAPHICS.

HE J;LEI J;LI G,NA,"SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING LABORATORY, NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY, CHANGSHA, 410072, CHINA",J. IMAGE AND GRAPHICS,"OBJECTIVE: TEMPORAL ACTION LOCALIZATION IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TASKS IN VIDEO UNDERSTANDING AND HAS GREAT APPLICATION PROSPECTS IN PRACTICE. WITH THE RISE OF VARIOUS ONLINE VIDEO APPLICATIONS, THE NUMBER OF SHORT VIDEOS ON THE INTERNET HAS INCREASED SHARPLY, MANY OF WHICH CONTAIN DIFFERENT HUMAN BEHAVIORS. A MODEL THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY LOCATE AND CLASSIFY HUMAN ACTION SEGMENTS IN VIDEOS IS NEEDED TO DETECT AND DISTINGUISH HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN SHORT VIDEOS QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY. HOWEVER, PUBLIC SECURITY DEPARTMENTS ALSO NEED REAL-TIME HUMAN BEHAVIOR DETECTION SYSTEMS TO HELP MONITOR AND PROVIDE EARLY WARNING OF PUBLIC SAFETY INCIDENTS. IN THE TASK OF TEMPORAL ACTION LOCALIZATION, THE HUMAN ACTION SEGMENTS IN A VIDEO MUST BE CLASSIFIED AND REGRESSED SIMULTANEOUSLY. ACCURATELY LOCATING THE BOUNDARIES OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR SEGMENTS IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN CLASSIFYING KNOWN SEGMENTS. A VIDEO ALWAYS CONTAINS ACTION SEGMENTS OF DIFFERENT TEMPORAL LENGTHS, AND DETECTING ACTION SEGMENTS WITH A SHORT DURATION IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE SHORT-DURATION ACTION SEGMENT IS EASILY IGNORED BY THE DETECTION MODEL OR REGARDED AS PART OF A CLOSER, LONGER-DURATION SEGMENT. EXISTING METHODS HAVE VARIOUS ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE THE DETECTION ACCURACY OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR FRAGMENTS WITH DIFFERENT DURATIONS. IN THIS PAPER, A 3D FEATURE PYRAMID HIERARCHY IS PROPOSED TO ENHANCE THE NETWORK'S ABILITY TO DETECT ACTION SEGMENTS OF DIFFERENT TEMPORAL DURATIONS. METHOD: A NEW TWO-STAGE NETWORK WITH A PROPOSAL NETWORK FOLLOWED BY A CLASSIFIER NAMED 3D FEATURE PYRAMID CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK(3D-FPCN) IS PROPOSED. IN 3D-FPCN, FEATURE EXTRACTION IS PERFORMED THROUGH THE 3D FEATURE PYRAMID FEATURE EXTRACTION NETWORK BUILT. THE 3D FEATURE PYRAMID FEATURE EXTRACTION NETWORK HAS A BOTTOM-UP PATHWAY AND A TOP-DOWN PATHWAY. THE BOTTOM-UP PATHWAY SIMULTANEOUSLY ENCODES THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CONSECUTIVE INPUT FRAMES THROUGH A SERIES OF 3D CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS TO OBTAIN HIGHLY ABSTRACT FEATURE MAPS. THE TOP-DOWN PATHWAY USES A SERIES OF DECONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS AND LATERAL CONNECTION LAYERS TO FUSE HIGH-ABSTRACTION AND HIGH-RESOLUTION FEATURES, AND OBTAIN LOW-LEVEL FEATURE MAPS. THROUGH THE FEATURE PYRAMID FEATURE EXTRACTION NETWORK, MULTILEVEL FEATURE MAPS WITH DIFFERENT ABSTRACTION LEVELS AND DIFFERENT RESOLUTIONS CAN BE OBTAINED. HIGHLY ABSTRACT FEATURE MAPS ARE USED FOR THE CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION OF LONG-DURATION HUMAN ACTION SEGMENTS, AND HIGH-RESOLUTION FEATURE MAPS ARE USED FOR THE REGRESSION AND CLASSIFICATION OF SHORT-DURATION HUMAN ACTION SEGMENTS, WHICH CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE DETECTION EFFECT OF THE NETWORK ON HUMAN BEHAVIOR FRAGMENTS OF DIFFERENT DURATIONS. THE WHOLE NETWORK TAKES RGB FRAMES AS INPUT AND GENERATES FEATURE MAPS OF DIFFERENT RESOLUTIONS AND ABSTRACT DEGREES VIA A FEATURE PYRAMID STRUCTURE. THESE FEATURE MAPS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS MAINLY PLAY A ROLE IN THE LATTER TWO STAGES OF THE NETWORK. FIRST, THE ANCHOR MECHANISM IS USED IN THE PROPOSAL STAGE. THUS, ANCHOR SEGMENTS OF DIFFERENT TEMPORAL LENGTHS HAVE CORRESPONDING RECEPTIVE FIELDS OF DIFFERENT SIZES, AND THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO A RECEPTIVE FIELD CALIBRATION. SECOND, IN THE REGION OF INTEREST POOLING STAGE, DIFFERENT PROPOSAL SEGMENTS ARE MAPPED TO CORRESPONDING LEVEL FEATURE MAPS FOR PREDICTION, WHICH MAKES FEATURE PREDICTION MORE TARGETED AND BALANCES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ABSTRACTION AND RESOLUTION OF FEATURE MAPS FOR ACTION SEGMENTS' CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION. RESULT: OUR MODEL IS EVALUATED ON THE THUMOS'14 DATASET. COMPARED WITH OTHER CLASSIC METHODS THAT DO NOT USE OPTICAL FLOW FEATURES, OUR NETWORK SURPASSES MOST OF THEM. SPECIFICALLY, WHEN THE INTERSECTION OVER UNION THRESHOLD IS SET TO 0.5, THE MEAN AVERAGE PRECISION (MAP) OF 3D-FPCN IS UP TO 37.4%. COMPARED WITH THE CLASSIC TWO-STAGE NETWORK REGION CONVOLUTIONAL 3D NETWORK(R-C3D), THE MAP OF OUR METHOD IS INCREASED BY 8.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE COMPARISON RESULTS OF THE DETECTION PRECISION ON DIFFERENT CLASS HUMAN ACTION SEGMENTS WHEN THE INTERSECTION RATIO THRESHOLD IS 0.5 ARE SHOWN. THE DETECTION RESULT OF 3D-FPCN FOR SHORT-DURATION HUMAN ACTIONS SEGMENTS IS GREATLY IMPROVED COMPARED WITH OTHER METHODS. FOR EXAMPLE, 3D-FPCN'S DETECTION ACCURACY OF BASKETBALL DUNK AND CLIFF DIVING IS 10% HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE SAME TWO-STAGE NETWORK METHOD R-C3D, AND THE DETECTION ACCURACY OF POLE VAULT IS HIGHER THAN THE MULTI-STAGE SEGMENT CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK(SCNN) IS ABOUT 40%. THIS FINDING PROVES THE IMPROVEMENT OF OUR MODEL FOR DETECTING SHORT-DURATION HUMAN ACTION SEGMENTS. AN ABLATION TEST IS ALSO CONDUCTED IN THE FEATURE PYRAMID FEATURE EXTRACTION NETWORK TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF THIS STRUCTURE ON THE MODEL. WHEN THE FEATURE PYRAMID STRUCTURE IS REMOVED FROM THE NETWORK, THE DETECTION ACCURACY OF THE NETWORK IS APPROXIMATELY 2% LOWER THAN BEFORE WHEN THE INTERSECTION OVER UNION THRESHOLD IS 0.5. WHEN ONLY THE MULTILEVEL FEATURE MAP GENERATED BY THE FEATURE PYRAMID STRUCTURE IS USED IN THE FIRST STAGE OF THE NETWORK, WHICH IS THE PROPOSAL GENERATION STAGE, THE DETECTION ACCURACY IS ONLY 0.2% HIGHER THAN THE MODEL WITH THE FEATURE PYRAMID STRUCTURE REMOVED. THIS FINDING PROVES THAT THE FEATURE PYRAMID HIERARCHY CAN EFFECTIVELY ENHANCE THE DETECTION OF ACTION WITH DIFFERENT DURATIONS, AND IT MAINLY WORKS IN THE SECOND STAGE OF THE NETWORK, WHICH IS REGION OF INTEREST POOLING STAGE. CONCLUSION: A TWO-STAGE TEMPORAL ACTION LOCALIZATION NETWORK 3D-FPCN IS PROPOSED BASED ON 3D FEATURE PYRAMID FEATURE EXTRACTION NETWORK. THE NETWORK TAKES CONTINUOUS RGB FRAMES AS INPUT, WHICH CAN QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY DETECT HUMAN ACTION SEGMENTS IN SHORT VIDEOS. THROUGH A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS, THE SUPERIORITY OF THE MODEL IS PROVEN, AND THE MECHANISM OF THE 3D FEATURE PYRAMID STRUCTURE IN THE MODEL IS DISCUSSED AND EXPLORED. THE 3D FEATURE PYRAMID STRUCTURE EFFECTIVELY IMPROVES THE MODEL'S ABILITY TO DETECT SHORT-DURATION HUMAN ACTION SEGMENTS, BUT THE OVERALL MAP OF THE MODEL REMAINS LOW. IN THE NEXT WORK, THE MODEL WILL BE IMPROVED, AND DIFFERENT FEATURE INPUTS WILL BE INTRODUCED TO STUDY THE METHOD OF TEMPORAL ACTION LOCALIZATION FURTHER. WE HOPE THAT OUR WORK CAN INSPIRE OTHER RESEARCHERS AND PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIELD. © 2021, EDITORIAL AND PUBLISHING BOARD OF JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND GRAPHICS.

SCI.,"FISH SPECIES CLASSIFICATION IN UNDERWATER IMAGES IS AN EMERGING RESEARCH AREA FOR SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD OF IMAGE PROCESSING. FISH SPECIES CLASSIFICATION IN UNDERWATER IMAGES IS AN IMPORTANT TASK FOR FISH SURVEY I.E. TO AUDIT ECOLOGICAL BALANCE, MONITORING FISH POPULATION AND PRESERVING ENDANGERED SPECIES. BUT THE PHENOMENON OF LIGHT SCATTERING AND ABSORPTION IN OCEAN WATER LEADS TO HAZY, DULL AND LOW CONTRAST IMAGES MAKING FISH CLASSIFICATION A TEDIOUS AND TOUGH TASK. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) CAN BE THE SOLUTION FOR FISH SPECIES CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM BUT THE SCARCITY OF AMPLE FISH IMAGES LEADS TO THE SERIOUS ISSUE OF TRAINING A NEURAL NETWORK FROM SCRATCH. TO OVERCOME THE ISSUE OF LIMITED DATASET THE PRESENT PAPER PROPOSES A TRANSFER LEARNING BASED FISH SPECIES CLASSIFICATION METHOD FOR UNDERWATER IMAGES. RESNET-50 NETWORK HAS BEEN USED FOR TRANSFER LEARNING AS IT REDUCES THE VANISHING GRADIENT PROBLEM TO MINIMUM BY USING RESIDUAL BLOCKS AND THUS IMPROVING THE ACCURACIES. TRAINING ONLY LAST FEW LAYERS OF RESNET-50 NETWORK WITH TRANSFER LEARNING INCREASES THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY DESPITE OF SCARCE DATASET. THE PROPOSED METHOD HAS BEEN TESTED ON TWO DATASETS COMPRISING OF 27, 370 (I.E. LARGE DATASET) AND 600 IMAGES (I.E. SMALL DATASET) WITHOUT ANY DATA AUGMENTATION. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEPICT THAT THE PROPOSED NETWORK ACHIEVES A VALIDATION ACCURACY OF 98.44 % FOR LARGE DATASET AND 84.92 % FOR SMALLER DATASET.

HOWEVER, ASSESSING DOMINANCE HIERARCHY CAN BE A TIME-CONSUMING ACTIVITY WHICH IS POTENTIALLY IMPEDED BY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, DIFFICULTIES IN THE RECOGNITION OF ANIMALS, OR DISTURBANCE OF ANIMALS DURING DATA COLLECTION. HERE WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF NOVEL DEVICES, MACHINES FOR AUTOMATED LEARNING AND TESTING (MALT), DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO STUDY NON-HUMAN PRIMATE COGNITION, TO ADDITIONALLY MEASURE THE DOMINANCE HIERARCHY OF A SEMI-FREE-RANGING PRIMATE GROUP. WHEN WORKING ON A MALT, AN ANIMAL CAN BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER, WHICH COULD REFLECT AN ASYMMETRIC DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIP. TO ASSESS THE RELIABILITY OF OUR METHOD, WE ANALYSED A SAMPLE OF THE AUTOMATED CONFLICTS WITH VIDEO SCORING AND FOUND THAT 74% OF THESE REPLACEMENTS INCLUDED GENUINE FORMS OF SOCIAL DISPLACEMENTS. IN 10% OF THE CASES, WE DID NOT IDENTIFY SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND IN THE REMAINING 16% WE OBSERVED AFFILIATIVE CONTACTS BETWEEN THE MONKEYS. WE ANALYSED MONTHS OF DAILY USE OF MALT BY UP TO 26 SEMI-FREE-RANGING TONKEAN MACAQUES (MACACA TONKEANA) AND FOUND THAT DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIPS INFERRED FROM THESE INTERACTIONS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH THE ONES DERIVED FROM OBSERVATIONS OF SPONTANEOUS AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD. AN OPTIONAL FILTERING PROCEDURE DESIGNED TO EXCLUDE CHANCE-DRIVEN DISPLACEMENTS OR AFFILIATIVE CONTACTS SUGGESTS THAT THE PRESENCE OF 26% OF THESE INTERACTIONS IN DATA SETS DID NOT IMPAIR THE RELIABILITY OF THIS NEW METHOD. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS METHOD CAN BE USED TO ASSESS THE DYNAMICS OF BOTH INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL STATUS, AND GROUP-WIDE HIERARCHICAL STABILITY LONGITUDINALLY WITH MINIMAL RESEARCH LABOUR. FURTHER, IT FACILITATES A CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT OF DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES IN CAPTIVE GROUPS, EVEN DURING UNPREDICTABLE ENVIRONMENTAL OR CHALLENGING SOCIAL EVENTS, WHICH UNDERLINES THE USEFULNESS OF THIS METHOD FOR GROUP MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. ALTOGETHER, THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE USE OF MALT AS A RELIABLE TOOL TO AUTOMATICALLY AND DYNAMICALLY ASSESS DOMINANCE HIERARCHY WITHIN CAPTIVE GROUPS OF NON-HUMAN PRIMATES, INCLUDING JUVENILES, UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH SUCH TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED. © 2021, JAPAN MONKEY CENTRE.",NA,AUTOMATION; DOMINANCE RANK; MACAQUES; MONKEYS; SOCIAL CONFLICTS; SOCIAL INTERACTIONS,NA,"BALLESTA, S.; LABORATOIRE DE NEUROSCIENCES COGNITIVES ET ADAPTATIVES, FRANCE; EMAIL: BALLESTA@UNISTRA.FR",ARTICLE,10.1007/s10329-021-00909-7,NA,UNIVERSITÉ DE STRASBOURGUNIVERSITÉ DE STRASBOURG,NA,00328332,PRIMATES,ENGLISH,CITED BY 2,4,595-607,SPRINGER JAPAN,33847852,SCOPUS,ASSESSING THE RELIABILITY OF AN AUTOMATED METHOD FOR MEASURING DOMINANCE HIERARCHY IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104551446&doi=10.1007%2fs10329-021-00909-7&partnerID=40&md5=5db4bd0320873b0aa548943f858d852e,62,2021,THE AUTHORS ARE GRATEFUL TO THE UNIVERSITY OF STRASBOURG AND SILABE (HTTPS://SILABE.COM/ ) FOR SUPPORTING THIS RESEARCH AND PROVIDING EXPERT ANIMAL CARE.

ANAL. PREV.,"PEDESTRIANS ARE VULNERABLE WHEN CROSSING THE STREET, ESPECIALLY AT NON-SIGNALIZED CROSSWALKS. IN CHINA, IN SPITE OF THE PRIORITY THAT LAWS ENTITLE THE PEDESTRIANS, THE YIELDING RATES AT NON-SIGNALIZED CROSSWALKS ARE RELATIVELY LOW. IN LIGHT OF THIS SITUATION, LAW ENFORCEMENT CAMERAS HAVE BEEN USED TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF DRIVERS YIELDING TO PEDESTRIANS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CAMERAS ON DRIVERS YIELDING BEHAVIOR AND VEHICLE-PEDESTRIAN CONFLICTS AT NON-SIGNALIZED CROSSWALKS. USING UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV) AND ROADSIDE VIDEO RECORDING, INFORMATION INCLUDING PEDESTRIAN CHARACTERISTICS, VEHICULAR CHARACTERISTICS AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ARE COLLECTED. THE CONFLICT INDICATORS USED INCLUDE POST-ENCROACHMENT TIME (PET), TIME TO COLLISION (TTC), AND DECELERATION TO SAFETY TIME (DST). IN THIS STUDY, A CONFLICT CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK BASED ON PET, TTC AND DST USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE ALGORITHM IS EMPLOYED. A MULTINOMIAL LOGIT REGRESSION MODEL IS USED TO IDENTIFY THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE CONFLICTS. THEN, BINARY LOGIT REGRESSION MODELS ARE CONSTRUCTED TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CAMERAS ON DRIVERS YIELDING BEHAVIOR. CONFLICT STUDY REVEALS THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CAMERAS WOULD INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF SLIGHT CONFLICT BUT DECREASE THE PROBABILITY OF SERIOUS CONFLICT. YIELDING BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE ILLEGITIMATE YIELDING BEHAVIOR PERCENTAGES ARE OVER 10 %, INDICATING THE NECESSITY OF IMPROVING THE AWARENESS OF YIELDING RULES, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CAMERAS WOULD INCREASE THE YIELDING AND LEGITIMATE YIELDING PROBABILITY. MOREOVER, FACTORS INCLUDING THE ADJACENT VEHICLE YIELDING BEHAVIOR, NUMBER OF LANES BETWEEN PEDESTRIAN AND VEHICLE, PEDESTRIAN SPEED CHANGE, PEDESTRIAN WAITING TIME, PEDESTRIAN ACCEPTED GAP TIME, VEHICLE UPSTREAM SPEED AND VEHICLE SPEED CHANGE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CONFLICT SEVERITY AND DRIVERS YIELDING BEHAVIOR.

SCI.,"AUTOMATED HUMAN ACTION RECOGNITION IS ONE OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE AND PRACTICAL RESEARCH FIELDS IN COMPUTER VISION. IN SUCH SYSTEMS, THE HUMAN ACTION LABELLING IS BASED ON THE APPEARANCE AND PATTERNS OF THE MOTIONS IN THE VIDEO SEQUENCES; HOWEVER, MAJORITY OF THE EXISTING RESEARCH AND MOST OF THE CONVENTIONAL METHODOLOGIES AND CLASSIC NEURAL NETWORKS EITHER NEGLECT OR ARE NOT ABLE TO USE TEMPORAL INFORMATION FOR ACTION RECOGNITION PREDICTION IN A VIDEO SEQUENCE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE COMPUTATIONAL COST OF A PROPER AND ACCURATE HUMAN ACTION RECOGNITION IS HIGH. IN THIS PAPER, WE ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF THE PREPROCESSING PHASE, BY AN AUTOMATED SELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVE FRAMES FROM THE INPUT SEQUENCES. WE EXTRACT THE KEY FEATURES OF THE REPRESENTATIVE FRAME RATHER THAN THE ENTIRE FEATURES. WE PROPOSE A HIERARCHICAL TECHNIQUE USING BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION AND HOG, FOLLOWED BY APPLICATION OF A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK AND SKELETAL MODELLING METHOD. THE COMBINATION OF A CNN AND THE LSTM RECURSIVE NETWORK IS CONSIDERED FOR FEATURE SELECTION AND MAINTAINING THE PREVIOUS INFORMATION; AND FINALLY, A SOFTMAX-KNN CLASSIFIER IS USED FOR LABELLING THE HUMAN ACTIVITIES. WE NAME OUR MODEL AS “HIERARCHICAL FEATURE REDUCTION & DEEP LEARNING”-BASED ACTION RECOGNITION METHOD, OR HFR-DL IN SHORT.

MALWARE ANALYSIS IS NEEDED TO DEFEND AGAINST ITS SOPHISTICATED BEHAVIOUR. HOWEVER, THE MANUAL HEURISTIC INSPECTION IS NO LONGER EFFECTIVE OR EFFICIENT. TO COPE WITH THESE CRITICAL ISSUES, BEHAVIOUR-BASED MALWARE DETECTION APPROACHES WITH MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED AS A SOLUTION.

HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS OF EGG RECOGNITION AND DISCRIMINATION ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. MOST STUDIES HAVE PUT THEIR FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL ABILITIES TO CARRY OUT THESE BEHAVIOURAL TASKS, WHILE LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE EGG AND HOW ITS SIGNALS MAY EVOLVE TO ENHANCE ITS IDENTIFICATION. WE USED 92 CLUTCHES (460 EGGS) OF THE EURASIAN COOT FULICA ATRA TO TEST WHETHER EGGS COULD BE CORRECTLY CLASSIFIED INTO THEIR CORRESPONDING CLUTCHES BASED ONLY ON THEIR EXTERNAL APPEARANCE. USING SPOTEGG, WE CHARACTERIZED THE EGGS IN 27 VARIABLES OF COLOUR, SPOTTINESS, SHAPE AND SIZE FROM CALIBRATED DIGITAL IMAGES. THEN, WE USED THESE VARIABLES IN A SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR MULTI-CLASS EGG CLASSIFICATION, WHERE EACH EGG WAS CLASSIFIED TO THE BEST MATCHED CLUTCH OUT OF 92 STUDIED CLUTCHES. THE BEST MODEL WITH ALL 27 EXPLANATORY VARIABLES ASSIGNED CORRECTLY 53.3% (CI = 42.6-63.7%) OF EGGS OF THE TEST-SET, GREATLY EXCEEDING THE PROBABILITY TO CLASSIFY THE EGGS BY CHANCE (1/92, 1.1%). THIS FINDING SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EGGS HAVE VISUAL IDENTITY SIGNALS IN THEIR PHENOTYPES. SIMPLIFIED MODELS WITH FEWER EXPLANATORY VARIABLES (10 OR 15) SHOWED LESSER CLASSIFICATION ABILITY THAN FULL MODELS, SUGGESTING THAT BIRDS MAY USE MULTIPLE TRAITS FOR EGG RECOGNITION. THEREFORE, EGG PHENOTYPES SHOULD BE ASSESSED IN THEIR FULL COMPLEXITY, INCLUDING COLOUR, PATTERNING, SHAPE AND SIZE. MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES FOR CLASSIFICATION WERE THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST INTRACLUTCH CORRELATION, DEMONSTRATING THAT INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION TRAITS ARE REPEATABLE. ALGORITHM CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BY EACH EXTRA TRAINING EGG ADDED TO THE MODEL. THUS, REPETITION OF EGG DESIGN WITHIN A CLUTCH WOULD REINFORCE SIGNALS AND WOULD HELP FEMALES TO CREATE AN INTERNAL TEMPLATE FOR TRUE RECOGNITION OF THEIR OWN EGGS. IN CONCLUSION, OUR NOVEL APPROACH BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING PROVIDED IMPORTANT INSIGHTS ON HOW SIGNALLERS BROADCAST THEIR SPECIFIC SIGNATURE CUES TO ENHANCE THEIR RECOGNISABILITY.

THIS STUDY DEVELOPS A DEEP LEARNING-BASED IMAGE PROCESSING PIPELINE THAT AIMS TO ESTIMATE THE CONSUMPTION OF CORN BY IDENTIFYING CORN AND ITS BARE COB FROM THESE IMAGES, WHICH WILL AID IN TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS IN THE GMO CORN EXPERIMENT. ABLATION USES MASK REGIONAL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (MASK R-CNN) FOR INSTANCE SEGMENTATION. BASED ON IMAGE DATA ANNOTATION, TWO APPROACHES FOR SEGMENTATION WERE DISCUSSED: IDENTIFYING WHOLE CORN EARS AND BARE COB PARTS WITH AND WITHOUT CORN KERNELS. THE MASK R-CNN MODEL WAS TRAINED FOR BOTH APPROACHES AND SEGMENTATION RESULTS WERE COMPARED. OUT OF THE TWO, THE LATTER APPROACH, I.E., WITHOUT THE KERNEL, WAS CHOSEN TO ESTIMATE THE CORN CONSUMPTION BECAUSE OF ITS SUPERIOR SEGMENTATION PERFORMANCE AND ESTIMATION ACCURACY. ABLATION EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED WITH THE LATTER APPROACH TO OBTAIN THE BEST MODEL WITH THE AVAILABLE DATA. THE ESTIMATION RESULTS OF THESE MODELS WERE INCLUDED AND COMPARED WITH MANUALLY LABELED TEST DATA WITH R2 = 0.99 WHICH SHOWED THAT USE OF THE MASK R-CNN MODEL TO ESTIMATE CORN CONSUMPTION PROVIDES HIGHLY ACCURATE RESULTS, THUS, ALLOWING IT TO BE USED FURTHER ON ALL COLLECTED DATA AND HELP TEST THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE GMO CORN EXPERIMENT.

IN OUR PREVIOUS WORK [WANG ET AL., LAB CHIP, 2016, 21, 4212-4219], AUTOMATED DESIGN OF MICROFLUIDIC MIXERS BY PRE-GENERATING A RANDOM LIBRARY WITH THE FEA WAS PROPOSED. HOWEVER, THE DURATION OF THE SIMULATION PROCESS IS TIME-CONSUMING, WHILE THE MATCHING CONSISTENCY BETWEEN LIMITED PRE-GENERATED DESIGNS AND USER DESIRE IS NOT STABLE. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, WE INVENTIVELY TRANSFORMED THE FLUID MECHANICS PROBLEM INTO AN IMAGE RECOGNITION PROBLEM AND PRESENTED A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN)-BASED TECHNIQUE TO PREDICT THE FLUID BEHAVIOR OF RANDOM MICROFLUIDIC MIXERS. THE PRE-GENERATED 10 513 CANDIDATE DESIGNS IN THE RANDOM LIBRARY WERE USED IN THE TRAINING PROCESS OF THE CNN, AND THEN 30 757 BRAND NEW MICROFLUIDIC MIXER DESIGNS WERE RANDOMLY GENERATED, WHOSE PERFORMANCE WAS PREDICTED BY THE CNN. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE CNN METHOD COULD COMPLETE ALL THE PREDICTIONS IN JUST 10 SECONDS, WHICH WAS AROUND 51 600× FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS FEA METHOD. THE CNN LIBRARY WAS EXTENDED TO CONTAIN 41 270 CANDIDATE DESIGNS, WHICH HAS FILLED UP THOSE EMPTY SPACES IN THE FLUID VELOCITY VERSUS SOLUTE CONCENTRATION MAP OF THE RANDOM LIBRARY, AND ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE CHOICES AND POSSIBILITIES FOR USER DESIRE. BESIDES, THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS HAS CONFIRMED THE INCREASED COMPATIBILITY OF THE CNN LIBRARY WITH USER DESIRE. IN SUMMARY, OUR CNN METHOD NOT ONLY PRESENTS A MUCH FASTER WAY OF GENERATING A MORE COMPLETE LIBRARY WITH CANDIDATE MIXER DESIGNS BUT ALSO PROVIDES A SOLUTION FOR PREDICTING FLUID BEHAVIOR USING A MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE.

WE PROPOSE A LOSS THAT PERFORMS SPECTRAL DECOMPOSITION ON THE POPULATION AUGMENTATION GRAPH AND CAN BE SUCCINCTLY WRITTEN AS A CONTRASTIVE LEARNING OBJECTIVE ON NEURAL NET REPRESENTATIONS. MINIMIZING THIS OBJECTIVE LEADS TO FEATURES WITH PROVABLE ACCURACY GUARANTEES UNDER LINEAR PROBE EVALUATION. BY STANDARD GENERALIZATION BOUNDS, THESE ACCURACY GUARANTEES ALSO HOLD WHEN MINIMIZING THE TRAINING CONTRASTIVE LOSS. EMPIRICALLY, THE FEATURES LEARNED BY OUR OBJECTIVE CAN MATCH OR OUTPERFORM SEVERAL STRONG BASELINES ON BENCHMARK VISION DATASETS.

INTELLIGENT INFRASTRUCT.,"TRANSFER LEARNING, IN THE FORM OF DOMAIN ADAPTATION, SEEKS TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH A LACK OF AVAILABLE HEALTH-STATE DATA FOR A STRUCTURE, WHICH SEVERELY LIMITS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONVENTIONAL MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES TO STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING (SHM). THESE TECHNOLOGIES SEEK TO UTILISE LABELLED INFORMATION ACROSS A POPULATION OF STRUCTURES (AND PHYSICS-BASED MODELS), SUCH THAT INFERENCES ARE IMPROVED EITHER FOR THE COMPLETE POPULATION, OR FOR PARTICULAR TARGET STRUCTURES; ENABLING A POPULATION-BASED VIEW OF SHM. THE AIM OF THESE METHODS IS TO INFER A MAPPING BETWEEN EACH MEMBER OF THE POPULATION'S FEATURE SPACE (CALLED A DOMAIN) IN WHICH A CLASSIFIER TRAINED ON ONE MEMBER OF THE POPULATION WILL GENERALISE TO THE REMAINING STRUCTURES. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO INTRODUCE A DOMAIN ADAPTATION METHOD FOR POPULATION-BASED STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING (PBSHM) THAT IS FORMED FROM A GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL (GMM). THE METHOD, THE DOMAIN-ADAPTED GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL (DA-GMM), SEEKS TO INFER A LINEAR MAPPING THAT TRANSFORMS TARGET DATA FROM ONE STRUCTURE ONTO A GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL THAT HAS BEEN INFERRED FROM SOURCE DOMAIN DATA (FROM ANOTHER STRUCTURE). THE PROPOSED MODEL IS SOLVED VIA AN EXPECTATION MAXIMISATION TECHNIQUE. THE METHOD IS DEMONSTRATED ON THREE CASE STUDIES: AN ARTIFICIAL DATASET DEMONSTRATING THE APPROACH'S EFFECTIVENESS WHEN THE TARGET DOMAIN DIFFERS BY TWO-DIMENSIONAL ROTATIONS, A POPULATION OF TWO NUMERICAL SHEAR-BUILDING STRUCTURES AND A POPULATION OF TWO BRIDGES, THE Z24 AND KW51 BRIDGES. IN EACH CASE STUDY, THE METHOD IS SHOWN TO PROVIDE INFORMATIVE RESULTS, OUTPERFORMING OTHER CONVENTIONAL FORMS OF GMM (WHERE NO TARGET LABELLED DATA ARE ASSUMED AVAILABLE), AND PROVIDE MAPPINGS THAT ALLOW THE EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE OF LABELLED INFORMATION FROM SOURCE TO TARGET DATASETS. © 2021 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING OF INTELLIGENT INFRASTRUCTURE: TRANSFERRING RESEARCH INTO PRACTICE, SHMII.

INTUITIVELY, SIMILAR TO THE HUMAN GROUP STUDY MECHANISM, WE INDUCE STUDENTS TO LEARN AND EXCHANGE DIFFERENT PARTS OF COURSE KNOWLEDGE AS COLLABORATIVE GROUPS. FIRST, EACH STUDENT IS ESTABLISHED BY RANDOMLY ROUTING ON A MODULAR NEURAL NETWORK, WHICH FACILITATES FLEXIBLE KNOWLEDGE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN STUDENTS DUE TO RANDOM LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION SHARING AND BRANCHING. SECOND, TO RESIST THE STUDENT HOMOGENIZATION, STUDENTS FIRST COMPOSE DIVERSE FEATURE SETS BY EXPLOITING THE INDUCTIVE BIAS FROM SUBSETS OF TRAINING DATA, AND THEN AGGREGATE AND DISTILL DIFFERENT COMPLEMENTARY KNOWLEDGE BY IMITATING A RANDOM SUBGROUP OF STUDENTS AT EACH TIME STEP. OVERALL, THE ABOVE MECHANISMS ARE BENEFICIAL FOR MAXIMIZING THE STUDENT POPULATION TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE MODEL GENERALIZATION WITHOUT SACRIFICING COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY.

IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS WORKS WHICH GENERALLY ASSUME THE GROUND TRUTH OF TRAINING DATA IS A PERFECT REFLECTION OF THE REALITY, WE CONSIDER HERE THE MORE COMMON IMPERFECT CASE OF GROUND TRUTH UNCERTAINTY IN THE WILD. WE FIRST ILLUSTRATE ITS MANIFESTATION AS VARIOUS KINDS OF ARTIFACTS INCLUDING ZIPPER EFFECT, COLOR MOIRE AND RESIDUAL NOISE. THEN WE FORMULATE A TWO-STAGE DATA DEGRADATION PROCESS TO CAPTURE SUCH GROUND TRUTH UNCERTAINTY, WHERE A CONJUGATE PRIOR DISTRIBUTION IS IMPOSED UPON A BASE DISTRIBUTION. AFTER THAT, WE DERIVE AN EVIDENCE LOWER BOUND (ELBO) LOSS TO TRAIN A NEURAL NETWORK THAT APPROXIMATES THE PARAMETERS OF THE CONJUGATE PRIOR DISTRIBUTION CONDITIONED ON THE DEGRADED INPUT.

IN RECENT YEARS, AUTOMATIC DATA AUGMENTATION METHODS, SUCH AS AUTOAUGMENT OR FAST AUTOAUGMENT HAVE BEEN ATTRACTING ATTENTION; AND THESE METHODS IMPROVED THE RESULTS OF IMAGE CLASSIFICATION AND OBJECT DETECTION TASKS. HOWEVER, SEVERAL PROBLEMS REMAIN. MOST NOTABLY, A LARGER TRAINING DATASET REQUIRES HIGHER COMPUTATIONAL COSTS. WHEN SEARCHING WITH A SMALL DATASET IN AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE DATA AUGMENTATION APPROACH, THE TRUE DATA SPACE AND SAMPLING DATA SPACE DO NOT FULLY CORRESPOND WITH EACH OTHER, THEREBY CAUSING THE GENERALIZATION PERFORMANCE TO DETERIORATE. MOREOVER, IN THE EXISTING AUTOMATIC AUGMENTATION METHODS, THE SEARCH PHASE IS OFTEN DOMINATED BY AN EXCEPTIONAL SUB-POLICY, WHICH RESULTS IN A LOSS OF DIVERSITY OF TRANSFORMATIONS. IN THIS STUDY, WE SOLVED THESE PROBLEMS BY INTRODUCING EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION TO PREVIOUS METHODS. AS MENTIONED EARLIER, MAINTAINING DIVERSITY OF TRANSFORMATIONS IS ESSENTIAL. THEREFORE, WE ADOPTED THE THERMODYNAMICAL GENETIC ALGORITHM (TDGA), WHICH CAN CONTROL THE POPULATION DIVERSITY WITH A SPECIFIC GENETIC OPERATOR, KNOWN AS THE THERMODYNAMICAL SELECTION RULE. TO CONFIRM THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED METHOD, COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED USING TWO BENCHMARK DATASETS, CIFAR-10 AND SVHN, AS EXAMPLES.

THE MOST PROMINENT APPROACH WAS TO INTRODUCE CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION (CCTV) CAMERA-BASED SURVEILLANCE TO TACKLE THE ISSUE. VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS HAVE ADDED A NEW DIMENSION TO DETECT CRIME. SEVERAL RESEARCH WORKS ON AUTONOMOUS SECURITY CAMERA SURVEILLANCE ARE CURRENTLY ONGOING, WHERE THE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL IS TO DISCOVER VIOLENT ACTIVITY FROM VIDEO FEEDS. FROM THE TECHNICAL VIEWPOINT, THIS IS A CHALLENGING PROBLEM BECAUSE ANALYZING A SET OF FRAMES, I.E., VIDEOS IN TEMPORAL DIMENSION TO DETECT VIOLENCE MIGHT NEED CAREFUL MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TRAINING TO REDUCE FALSE RESULTS. THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THIS PROBLEM BY INTEGRATING STATE-OF-THE-ART DEEP LEARNING METHODS TO ENSURE A ROBUST PIPELINE FOR AUTONOMOUS SURVEILLANCE FOR DETECTING VIOLENT ACTIVITIES, E.G., KICKING, PUNCHING, AND SLAPPING. INITIALLY, WE DESIGNED A DATASET OF THIS SPECIFIC INTEREST, WHICH CONTAINS 600 VIDEOS (200 FOR EACH ACTION). LATER, WE HAVE UTILIZED EXISTING PRE-TRAINED MODEL ARCHITECTURES TO EXTRACT FEATURES, AND LATER USED DEEP LEARNING NETWORK FOR CLASSIFICATION.

WE USE TWO-STAGE TRAINING METHOD TO SOLVE THE TASK OF SMALL SAMPLES DETECTION TASK. BASED ON THE TWO-STAGE TARGET DETECTOR FASTER R-CNN, WE ESTABLISHED A FEW SHOT TARGET DETECTION MODEL. THE TRAINING IS DIVIDED INTO TWO STAGES. THE FIRST STAGE IS TO TRAIN THE MODEL ON THE BASIC SET, AND THE SECOND STAGE IS TO ADJUST THE BALANCE SET OF THE NEW CLASS AND THE BASE CLASS ON THE LAST LAYER.

CURRENT GAME CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION SYSTEMS EITHER REQUIRE PLAYERS TO MANUALLY ADJUST CONSIDERABLE FACE ATTRIBUTES TO OBTAIN THE DESIRED FACE, OR HAVE LIMITED FREEDOM OF FACIAL SHAPE AND TEXTURE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE AN AUTOMATIC CHARACTER FACE CREATION METHOD THAT PREDICTS BOTH FACIAL SHAPE AND TEXTURE FROM A SINGLE PORTRAIT, AND IT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO MOST EXISTING 3D GAMES. ALTHOUGH 3D MORPHABLE FACE MODEL (3DMM) BASED METHODS CAN RESTORE ACCURATE 3D FACES FROM SINGLE IMAGES, THE TOPOLOGY OF 3DMM MESH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE MESHES USED IN MOST GAMES. TO ACQUIRE FIDELITY TEXTURE, EXISTING METHODS REQUIRE A LARGE AMOUNT OF FACE TEXTURE DATA FOR TRAINING, WHILE BUILDING SUCH DATASETS IS TIME-CONSUMING AND LABORIOUS. BESIDES, SUCH A DATASET COLLECTED UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS MAY NOT GENERALIZED WELL TO IN-THE-WILD SITUATIONS. TO TACKLE THESE PROBLEMS, WE PROPOSE 1) A LOW-COST FACIAL TEXTURE ACQUISITION METHOD, 2) A SHAPE TRANSFER ALGORITHM THAT CAN TRANSFORM THE SHAPE OF A 3DMM MESH TO GAMES, AND 3) A NEW PIPELINE FOR TRAINING 3D GAME FACE RECONSTRUCTION NETWORKS. THE PROPOSED METHOD NOT ONLY CAN PRODUCE DETAILED AND VIVID GAME CHARACTERS SIMILAR TO THE INPUT PORTRAIT, BUT CAN ALSO ELIMINATE THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHTING AND OCCLUSIONS.

VARIOUS CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK MODELS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED SUCH AS FASTER REGION-BASED, MASK REGION-BASED, SINGLE SHOT DETECTION, AND ""YOU ONLY LOOK ONCE""MODELS (WITH DIFFERENT VERSIONS). ALTHOUGH INSTANCE SEGMENTATION HAS BEEN EXPLORED WITH MANY MODELS, THE MASK REGION-BASED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE MODELS IN TERMS OF OVERALL OBJECT DETECTION PERFORMANCE. ITS WIDESPREAD USE IN MANY DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS ENCOURAGED US TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT MODEL PERFORMANCE IN A UNIQUE OBJECT DETECTION TASK, NAMELY THE DETECTION OF SPACECRAFT IMAGES IN THE WILD. THE MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION IN THIS PAPER, IS WHETHER THIS OFF-THE-SHELF PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE CAN EFFECTIVELY DETECT AND LOCALIZE A SPACECRAFT WHEN USING THE SPACECRAFT POSE ESTIMATION DATASET, UNDER A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT IMAGE DEGRADATION FACTORS AND AT VARIOUS DEGRADATION LEVELS. THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS INVESTIGATION IS THE EFFECT OF DEEP SPACE ENVIRONMENTS ON CHARGE-COUPLED DEVICE IMAGE SENSORS, AND OTHER IMAGING HARDWARE. THE CAPABILITY OF DETECTION AND LOCALIZATION TO CONTINUE IN THE FACE OF PIXEL LOSS AND GAUSSIAN NOISE ARE EXPLORED. THE EFFECTS OF TRAINING AUGMENTATION ON OBJECT DETECTION PERFORMANCE IS ANOTHER TASK THAT HAS ALSO BEEN STUDIED. SOME OF OUR MAIN FINDINGS INCLUDE THAT SUPPLEMENTING TRAINING ON DEGRADED IMAGES IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY THE DETECTION RESULTS. IN LOW DEGRADATION SCENARIOS, THE IMPROVEMENT IS BETTER THAN THE BASELINE RESULTS. ALSO, THE PROPOSED MODELS IS ABLE TO DETECT AND LOCALIZE PROPERLY ON SPACECRAFT IMAGES DEGRADED BY PIXEL LOSS.

OUR WORK IS MOTIVATED BY THE REASONING THAT THE ABILITY TO PREDICT SUCH OUTCOMES ENABLES TUTORING SYSTEMS TO ADJUST INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS HINTS AND ENCOURAGEMENT, AND TO ULTIMATELY YIELD IMPROVED STUDENT LEARNING. WE COLLECTED A LARGE LABELED DATASET OF STUDENT INTERACTIONS WITH AN INTELLIGENT ONLINE MATH TUTOR CONSISTING OF 68 SESSIONS, WHERE 54 INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS SOLVED 2, 749 PROBLEMS.

WE PROPOSE A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK CONSISTING OF TWO STAGES, THAT WE CALL 'WILDLIFENET', TO AUTOMATICALLY DETECT THE PRESENCE OF SPECIFIC WILDLIFE. WILDLIFENET IS OPTIMIZED FOR LOW POWER AND LOW MEMORY SO THAT IT CAN BE EMBEDDED IN EDGE DEVICES SUCH AS SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS OR LOW COST SPECIAL-PURPOSE CAMERAS.

THIS IS FOLLOWED BY OUR CUSTOM CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM THAT IDENTIFIES SPECIFIC ANIMAL SPECIES FROM THE ANIMALS DETECTED IN THE FIRST STAGE. WILDLIFENET USES IMAGES FROM SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS OR LOW COST CAMERAS PLACED NEAR TYPICAL ANIMAL PATHS TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF WILDLIFE.

HOWEVER, SUPER ACUITY PHENOMENA HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY REPORTED AMONG INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN NUMEROUS PARTS OF THE WORLD. UP TO NOW, FAR TOO LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO DEVELOP SPECIFIC LETTER CHARTS TO QUANTIFY SUPER ACUITY. MOST OF THE LETTER CHARTS ARE FABRICATED TO ESTIMATE RECOGNITION ACUITY UP TO 6/6. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A NEW LETTER CHART FOR SUPER ACUITY INVESTIGATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WITH THREE DISTINCT FEATURES. UITM CHEN-AZMIR-SAIFUL-HOE (UCASH) IS A SUPER-ACUITY LETTER CHART DESIGNED TO QUANTIFY THE RECOGNITION ACUITY UP TO 3/0.5 OR 6/1 SNELLEN NOTATION. UCASH IS CONSTRUCTED USING SINGLE LETTER DISPLAY DESIGN FOR A 3-METER TESTING DISTANCE. FOUR NEIGHBOURING CONTOUR BARS ARE INCORPORATED TO SIMULATE CROWDING EFFECT AND CONTROL THE ACCOMMODATION DURING ACUITY MEASUREMENTS. EACH ACUITY LEVEL OF UCASH HAS AN EQUAL OPTOTYPE COMBINATION THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE OPTICAL BLUR FROM SPHERICAL, AGAINST-THE-RULE ASTIGMATISM; WITH-THE-RULE ASTIGMATISM; AND OBLIQUE ASTIGMATISM DEFOCUS STIMULATION. UCASH INVOLVES TWO LETTERS FROM 3/30 TO 3/15 OR 6/60 TO 6/30 OF SNELLEN NOTATIONS AND FIVE LETTERS FROM 3/12 TO 3/0.5 OR 6/24 TO 6/1 OF SNELLEN NOTATIONS.

ENDANGERED ASIAN ELEPHANTS ARE MAIMED OR KILLED DURING SUCH ACCIDENTS, WHICH ALSO OFTEN RESULTS IN ORPHANED OR DISABLED ELEPHANTS. FURTHERMORE, RAILWAY SERVICES INCUR SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LOSSES AND DISRUPTIONS TO SERVICES ANNUALLY DUE TO SUCH ACCIDENTS. MOST ELEPHANT-TRAIN COLLISIONS OCCUR DUE TO A LACK OF ADEQUATE REACTION TIME DUE TO POOR DRIVER VISIBILITY AT SHARP TURNS, NIGHT-TIME OPERATION, AND POOR WEATHER CONDITIONS. INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS ALSO INDICATE THAT MOST COLLISIONS OCCUR IN LOCALISED 'HOTSPOTS' WHERE ELEPHANT PATHWAYS/CORRIDORS INTERSECT WITH RAILWAY TRACKS. TAKING THESE FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION, THIS WORK PROPOSES THE LEVERAGING OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) TECHNOLOGY TO DETECT ELEPHANTS USING AN RGB/INFRARED CAPABLE CAMERA, AROUND KNOWN HOTSPOTS ALONG THE RAILWAY TRACK. THE CNN WAS TRAINED USING A CURATED DATASET OF ELEPHANTS COLLECTED ON FIELD VISITS TO ELEPHANT SANCTUARIES AND WILDLIFE PARKS IN SRI LANKA. WITH THIS VISION-BASED DETECTION SYSTEM AT ITS CORE, A PROTOTYPE UNIT OF AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED AND TESTED.

THIS PAPER PROPOSES A MULTI-TASK SCALE ADAPTIVE LADDER NETWORK (MT-SALN) FOR GENERATING HIGH-ACCURACY CROWD DENSITY MAPS. THIS NETWORK, BASED ON VGG-16 NETWORK, CONSISTS OF SEVERAL SETS OF ADAPTIVE DILATED-CONVOLUTION MODULE (ADCM), A POSITION RECALIBRATION BRANCH (PRB) AND A DENSITY ESTIMATION BRANCH (DEB). WE EMPLOY ADCM IN DIFFERENT STAGES TO BROADEN THE WIDTH OF THE NETWORK AND INTRODUCE WEIGHTS FOR EACH CHANNEL PARAMETER THROUGH AN ATTENTION MECHANISM. THE RESIDUAL STRUCTURE ENABLES THE NETWORK MODEL TO HAVE A BACK PROPAGATION ABILITY EVEN THOUGH THE NUMBER OF NETWORK LAYERS IS LARGE. IN ADDITION, TRANSPOSED CONVOLUTION IS USED TO UPSAMPLE THE FEATURES SO THAT THEY CAN BE MERGED WITH OTHER LAYERS' FEATURES TO GENERATE A MORE REFINED DENSITY MAP WITH HIGH RESOLUTION. THE EXISTENCE OF PRB CAN EFFECTIVELY GUIDE THE NETWORK TO GENERATE CROWD DENSITY AT THE CORRECT LOCATION AND ACCELERATE NETWORK CONVERGENCE. THE LADDER ARCHITECTURE IS BENEFICIAL TO PRODUCE HIGH-QUALITY DENSITY MAPS.

SYS.,"NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE USED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) IN THE FIELD OF INFORMATION CONCEALMENT AS WELL AS STEGANALYSIS, ACHIEVING PROMISING RESULTS IN TERMS OF CAPACITY ANDINVISIBILITY. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE A CNN-BASED STEGANOGRAPHIC MODEL TO HIDE A COLORIMAGE WITHIN ANOTHER COLOR IMAGE. THE PROPOSED MODEL CONSISTS OF TWO SUB-NETWORKS: THEHIDING NETWORK IS USED BY THE SENDER TO CONCEAL THE SECRET IMAGE; AND THE REVEAL NETWORK ISUSED BY THE RECIPIENT TO EXTRACT THE SECRET IMAGE FROM THE STEGO IMAGE. THE ARCHITECTURE OFTHE CONCEALMENT SUB-NETWORK IS INSPIRED BY THE U-NET AUTO-ENCODER AND BENEFITS FROM THEADVANTAGES OF THE DILATED CONVOLUTION. THE REVEAL SUB-NETWORK IS INSPIRED BY THE AUTO-ENCODERARCHITECTURE. TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE HIDDEN SECRET IMAGE, THE MODEL IS TRAINED END TOEND: RATHER THAN TRAINING SEPARATELY, THE TWO SUB-NETWORKS ARE TRAINED SIMULTANEOUSLY A PAIROF NETWORKS. THE LOSS FUNCTION IS ELABORATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT FAVORS THE QUALITY OF THESTEGO IMAGE OVER THE SECRET IMAGE AS THE STEGO IMAGE IS THE ONE THAT COMES UNDER STEGANALYSISATTACKS. TO VALIDATE THE PROPOSED MODEL, WE CARRIED OUT SEVERAL TESTS ON A RANGE OF CHALLENGINGPUBLICLY AVAILABLE IMAGE DATASETS SUCH AS IMAGENET, LABELED FACES IN THE WILD (LFW), ANDPASCAL-VOC12. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD CAN DISSIMULATE AN IMAGE INTOANOTHER ONE WITH THE SAME SIZE, REACHING AN EMBEDDING CAPACITY OF 24 BIT PER PIXEL WITHOUTGENERATING VISUAL OR STRUCTURAL ARTEFACTS ON THE HOST IMAGE.

HOWEVER, TO APPLY A FACE AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM IN PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS, WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM MUST NOT TRY TO RECOGNIZE THE FACE OF AN UNKNOWN PERSON INTO KNOWN CATEGORIES, MEANING WE NEED TO REJECT FACES OF UNKNOWN PEOPLE IN OUR APPLICATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT THE LIMITATIONS OF RECENT DEEP LEARNING BASED METHODS IN FACE RECOGNITION TASKS. WE THEN PROPOSE TWO METHODS HELPING FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM HAVE THE ABILITY TO REJECT FACES FROM UNKNOWN PEOPLE BY USING OPEN-SET CONCEPTS. WE CONDUCT THE EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSET OF CASIA-WEBFACE DATASET, WITH A TRAIN SET THAT INCLUDES 7000 IMAGES OF 100 KNOWN PEOPLE AND A TEST SET THAT INCLUDES BOTH KNOWN AND UNKNOWN PEOPLE. WITHOUT REJECTING UNKNOWN FACES, THE REGULAR FACE RECOGNITION, I.E. THE BASELINE METHOD, YIELDS THE ACCURACY OF ONLY 45.9%, AS THE METHOD TRIES TO CLASSIFY ALL FACE PHOTOS INTO KNOWN CLASSES. OUR PROPOSED METHODS, WHICH ARE COMBINED DEEP NETWORK OF FACENET SYSTEM WITH RECENT OPEN SET METHODS, ARE CALLED LEARNING PLACEHOLDER ON FACENET (P-FACENET) AND FACENET WITH OPENMAX (O-FACENET). THEY ACHIEVE THE ACCURACY OF 83.6% AND 88.5% RESPECTIVELY. THIS IS A POTENTIAL APPROACH FOR AUTHENTICATION WITH FACE RECOGNITION TO DECREASE THE ERROR RATE OF THE MODEL WHEN RECOGNIZING FACES OF UNKNOWN PEOPLE IN THE WILD. © 2021, SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG.",NA,FACE AUTHENTICATION; FACE RECOGNITION; OPEN SET RECOGNITION,NA,"TRAN, M.-T.; UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCEVIET NAM; EMAIL: TMTRIET@FIT.HCMUS.EDU.VN",CONFERENCE PAPER,10.1007/978-3-030-91387-8_22,"DANG T.K., KUNG J., CHUNG T.M., TAKIZAWA M.",NA,9783030913861,03029743,LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (INCLUDING SUBSERIES LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LECTURE NOTES IN BIOINFORMATICS),ENGLISH,CITED BY 1,NA,338-355,SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA DEUTSCHLAND GMBH,NA,SCOPUS,FACE RECOGNITION IN THE WILD FOR SECURE AUTHENTICATION WITH OPEN SET APPROACH,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121122694&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-91387-8_22&partnerID=40&md5=f0774391f8f07b3e4d916d0fd22226bf,13076 LNCS,2021,"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

MATH. PHYS.,"IN THIS PAPER, AN IN-DEPTH STUDY AND ANALYSIS OF ATTRIBUTE MODELLING AND KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION OF MASSIVE IMAGES ARE CONDUCTED USING IMAGE RECOGNITION. FOR THE COMPLEXITY OF ASSOCIATION RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ATTRIBUTES OF INCOMPLETE DATA, A SINGLE-OUTPUT SUBNETWORK MODELLING METHOD FOR INCOMPLETE DATA IS PROPOSED TO BUILD A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL WITH EACH MISSING ATTRIBUTE AS OUTPUT ALONE AND OTHER ATTRIBUTES AS INPUT IN TURN, AND THE NETWORK STRUCTURE CAN DEEPLY PORTRAY THE ASSOCIATION RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EACH ATTRIBUTE AND OTHER ATTRIBUTES. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF INCOMPLETE MODEL INPUTS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF MISSING VALUES, WE PROPOSE TO TREAT AND DESCRIBE THE MISSING VALUES AS SYSTEM-LEVEL VARIABLES AND REALIZE THE ALTERNATE UPDATE OF NETWORK PARAMETERS AND DYNAMIC FILLING OF MISSING VALUES THROUGH ITERATIVE LEARNING AMONG SUBNETS. THE METHOD CAN EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE INFORMATION OF ALL THE PRESENT ATTRIBUTE VALUES IN INCOMPLETE DATA, AND THE OBTAINED SUBNETWORK POPULATION MODEL IS A FIT TO THE ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATION RELATIONSHIPS IMPLIED BY ALL THE PRESENT ATTRIBUTE VALUES IN INCOMPLETE DATA. THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EXISTING IMAGE SEMANTIC MODELLING ALGORITHMS ARE ANALYSED. TO REDUCE THE WORKLOAD OF MANUALLY LABELLING DATA, THIS PAPER PROPOSES THE USE OF A STREAMING LEARNING ALGORITHM TO AUTOMATICALLY PASS IMAGE-LEVEL SEMANTIC LABELS TO PIXEL REGIONS OF AN IMAGE, WHERE THE ALGORITHM DOES NOT NEED TO RELY ON EXTERNAL DETECTORS AND A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE OF THE DATASET. THEN, AN EFFICIENT DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MAPPING ALGORITHM IS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED FOR THE MICROPROCESSING ARCHITECTURE AND SOFTWARE PROGRAMMING FRAMEWORK OF THIS EDGE PROCESSOR, AND A LAYOUT SCHEME IS PROPOSED TO PLACE THE INPUT FEATURE MAPS OUTSIDE THE KERNEL DDR AND THE REORDERED CONVOLUTIONAL KERNEL MATRICES INSIDE THE KERNEL STORAGE BODY AND TO DESIGN CORRESPONDING EFFICIENT VECTORIZATION ALGORITHMS FOR THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL MATRIX CONVOLUTION COMPUTATION, MULTIDIMENSIONAL POOLING COMPUTATION, LOCAL LINEAR NORMALIZATION, ETC., WHICH EXIST IN THE DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK MODEL.

BIOL.,"WE DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF A NEW CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK-BASED PHOTO-IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHM FOR INDIVIDUAL HUMPBACK WHALES (MEGAPTERA NOVAEANGLIAE). THE METHOD USES A DENSELY CONNECTED CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK (DENSENET) TO EXTRACT SPECIAL KEYPOINTS OF AN IMAGE OF THE VENTRAL SURFACE OF THE FLUKE AND THEN A SEPARATE DENSENET TRAINED TO LOOK FOR FEATURES WITHIN THESE KEYPOINTS. THE EXTRACTED FEATURES ARE THEN COMPARED AGAINST THOSE OF THE REFERENCE SET OF PREVIOUSLY KNOWN HUMPBACK WHALES FOR SIMILARITY. THIS OFFERS THE POTENTIAL TO SUCCESSFULLY AUTOMATE RECOGNITION OF INDIVIDUALS IN LARGE PHOTOGRAPHIC DATASETS SUCH AS IN OCEAN BASIN-WIDE MARINE MAMMAL STUDIES. THE ALGORITHM REQUIRES MINIMAL IMAGE PRE-PROCESSING AND IS CAPABLE OF ACCURATE, RAPID MATCHING OF FAIR TO HIGH-QUALITY HUMPBACK FLUKE PHOTOGRAPHS. IN REAL WORLD TESTING COMPARED TO MANUAL IMAGE MATCHING, THE ALGORITHM REDUCES IMAGE MANAGEMENT TIME BY AT LEAST 98% AND REDUCES ERROR RATES OF MISSING POTENTIAL MATCHES FROM APPROXIMATELY 6–9% TO 1–3%.

THE PROJECT DOCUMENT WAS DEVELOPED ACCORDING TO THE ""NATIONAL ACTION PLAN ENSURING THE RECOVERY OF EMPLOYMENT AND INCOMES OF THE POPULATION, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND LONG-TERM STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC"" CONTROL IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION"". IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT INTRODUCING REMOTE FORMS OF SUPERVISION IS THE GENERAL IMPROVEMENT OF THE STATE CONTROL SYSTEM WITH A GENERAL DECREASE IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON BUSINESS ENTITIES. THE TASK IS ALSO TO IDENTIFY THE NEGATIVE TRENDS IN THE ACTIVITIES OF ORGANIZATIONS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE STAGES AND ADOPT PROACTIVE STATE RESPONSE MEASURES TO VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW. THE CONCEPT ESTABLISHES THAT THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REMOTE CONTROL AND CONTACT, FACE-TO-FACE FORMS IS THE MOST FULL USE AND SCIENCE-INTENSIVE PROCESSING OF DATA ACCUMULATED IN THE INFORMATION FIELD ABOUT THE ACTIVITY OF THE ECONOMIC UNIT. THE INFORMATION FIELD IS FORMED BY DEPARTMENTAL DATABASES COLLECTED IN THE UNIFIED INFORMATION SYSTEM OF ROSPOTREBNADZOR (EIAS) AND EXTERNAL STATE, MUNICIPAL AND OTHER DATABASES. AN ANALYSIS IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH REMOTE ACCESS TO INFORMATION. THE REMOTE CONTROL ALSO IMPLIES A GRADUAL, BUT SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF THE HARDWARE USE FOR FIXING OBJECTS AND PROCESSES STATUS (AUDIO-PHOTO-VIDEO TOOLS, SENSORS FOR MEASURING OBJECT PARAMETERS, ETC.). AN INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEM PROVIDES INFORMATION AND ANALYTICAL SUPPORT FOR THE ENTIRE CYCLE OF ACTIONS PROVIDED FOR BY THE REGULATIONS FOR CONDUCTING REMOTE CONTROL AND SUPERVISION ACTIVITIES. THE SYSTEM FOCUSES ON IDENTIFYING EVIDENCE OF VIOLATION OR COMPLIANCE WITH SANITARY LEGISLATION BASED ON THE STUDY OF TRANSMITTED INFORMATION. THE FUNCTIONING OF AN INTELLIGENT SYSTEM INVOLVES THE MODERN METHODS OF MACHINE PROCESSING OF BIG DATA (BIG DATA), INCLUDING ELEMENTS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS, ETC. THE DATA GENERATED IN THE SYSTEM IS SENT TO THE SHARED STORAGE OF THE EIAS FOR THE COMBINED PROCESSING DATA FROM REMOTE AND CONTACT SUPERVISION AND SYSTEMIC COMPLEX ANALYSIS WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF DATA FROM SOCIAL AND HYGIENIC MONITORING AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS. THE PHASED INTRODUCTION OF DISTANT CONTROL IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SERVICE REQUIRES THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE REGULATORY, METHODOLOGICAL, MATERIAL, AND TECHNICAL BASE, AS WELL AS THE HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT IN THE DIRECTION, INCREASING THE COMPUTER LITERACY OF EXPERT SPECIALISTS, PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE INFORMATION SYSTEM, ITS ADMINISTRATION, AND ENSURING UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DISTANT CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION WITH THE USE OF INFORMATION AND ANALYTICAL APPROACH CAN REDUCE FROM 15 TO 60% TIME FOR ONE SCHEDULED INSPECTION, DECREASE THE LABOUR COSTS OF INSPECTORS AND SPECIALISTS OF SUPERVISED FACILITIES, EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF INSPECTED OBJECTS. © 2021 IZDATEL'STVO MEDITSINA.

UNFORTUNATELY, THESE PRE-TRAINED CNN MODELS ARE COMPLEX AND HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CONVOLUTIONAL FILTERS. TO TACKLE SUCH A COMPLEXITY CHALLENGE, THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO EVOLVE A PRE-TRAINED VGG-19 USING AN EFFICIENT TWO-LAYERS OPTIMIZER. THE PROPOSED OPTIMIZER PERFORMS FILTERS SELECTION OF THE LAST LAYERS OF VGG-19 GUIDED BY THE ACCURACY OF THE LINEAR SVM CLASSIFIER. THE PROPOSED APPROACH HAS THREE MAIN ADVANTAGES. FIRSTLY, IT ADOPTS A POWERFUL TWO-LAYERS OPTIMIZER THAT WORKS WITH A MICRO SWARM POPULATION. SECONDLY, IT AUTOMATICALLY EVOLVES A LIGHTWEIGHT DEEP MODEL WHICH USES A SMALL NUMBER OF VGG-19 CONVOLUTIONAL FILTERS. THIRDLY, IT APPLIES THE DEVELOPED MODEL FOR REAL-WORLD ROAD DAMAGE DETECTION FROM DRONE-BASED IMAGES. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH, A TOTAL OF 529 IMAGES WERE CAPTURED BY USING A DRONE-BASED CAMERA FOR VARIOUS ROAD DAMAGES. REPORTED RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL ACHIEVED 96.4% F1-SCORE ACCURACY WITH A REDUCTION OF VGG-19 FILTER UP TO 52%.

LARGE-SCALE LABELED DATA AND DEEP LEARNING METHODS HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED THE PERFORMANCE OF IMAGE RECOGNITION. HOWEVER, THE PERFORMANCE OF FER IS STILL NOT IDEAL DUE TO THE LACK OF TRAINING DATA AND INCORRECT ANNOTATIONS (E.G., LABEL NOISES). AMONG EXISTING IN-THE-WILD FER DATASETS, RELIABLE ONES CONTAIN INSUFFIFICIENT DATA TO TRAIN ROBUST DEEP MODELS WHILE LARGE-SCALE ONES ARE ANNOTATED IN LOWER QUALITY. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE A SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHM NAMED PROGRESSIVE TEACHER (PT) TO UTILIZE RELIABLE FER DATASETS AS WELL AS LARGE-SCALE UNLABELED EXPRESSION IMAGES FOR EFFECTIVE TRAINING. ON THE ONE HAND, PT INTRODUCES SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING METHOD TO RELIEVE THE SHORTAGE OF DATA IN FER. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT SELECTS USEFUL LABELED TRAINING SAMPLES AUTOMATICALLY AND PROGRESSIVELY TO ALLEVIATE LABEL NOISE. PT USES SELECTED CLEAN LABELED DATA FOR COMPUTING THE SUPERVISED CLASSIFIFICATION LOSS AND UNLABELED DATA FOR UNSUPERVISED CONSISTENCY LOSS. EXPERIMENTS ON WIDELY-USED DATABASES RAF-DB AND FERPLUS VALIDATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR METHOD, WHICH ACHIEVES STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE WITH ACCURACY OF 89.57% ON RAF-DB.

THEY INCLUDE THE HEAD POSE ESTIMATION NETWORK, POSTURAL TRANSFORMER NETWORK, AND FACE GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS. IN THIS PAPER, WE EMPLOY THE FOLLOWING: (I) SWISH-B ACTIVATION FUNCTION THAT IS USED IN FACE GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS TO ACCELERATE THE CONVERGENCE SPEED OF THE CROSS-ENTROPY COST FUNCTION, (II) A SPECIAL PREJUDGMENT MONITOR THAT IS ADDED TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE DISCRIMINANT, AND (III) THE MODIFIED POSTURAL TRANSFORMER NETWORK THAT IS USED WITH 3D FACE RECONSTRUCTION NETWORK TO CORRECT FACES AT DIFFERENT EXPRESSION POSE ANGLES. OUR METHOD IMPROVES THE RESOLUTION OF FACE IMAGE AND PERFORMS WELL IN IMAGE RESTORATION. WE DEMONSTRATE HOW OUR METHOD CAN PRODUCE HIGH-QUALITY FACES, AND IT IS SUPERIOR TO THE MOST ADVANCED METHODS ON THE RECONSTRUCTION TASK OF BLIND FACES FOR IN-THE-WILD IMAGES; ESPECIALLY, OUR 8 × SR SSIM AND PSNR ARE, RESPECTIVELY, 0.078 AND 1.16 HIGHER THAN FSRNET IN AFLW. © 2021 TONGXIN WEI ET AL.",2384435,NA,NA,"WEI, T.; SCHOOL OF SOFTWARE, HENAN, CHINA; EMAIL: TONGXIN_WEI@FOXMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1155/2021/2384435,NA,NA,NA,1024123X,MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING,ENGLISH,CITED BY 0,NA,NA,HINDAWI LIMITED,NA,SCOPUS,FRGAN: A BLIND FACE RESTORATION WITH GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118990762&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f2384435&partnerID=40&md5=8bd968cb6bac8f4ddbf1bb6966fc17ad,2021,2021,"NA NA NA","SCHOOL OF SOFTWARE, ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY, HENAN, ZHENGZHOU, 450001, CHINA; STATE KEY LABORATORY OF MATHEMATICAL ENGINEERING AND ADVANCED COMPUTING, HENAN, ZHENGZHOU, 450001, CHINA",ISI,0,none,ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF MATHEMATICAL ENGINEERING AND ADVANCED COMPUTING,ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF MATHEMATICAL ENGINEERING AND ADVANCED COMPUTING,NA,"WEI T, 2021, ","WEI T, 2021, "

ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESSES HAVE BEEN MADE IN AUTOMATIC FER IN THE PAST FEW DECADES, PREVIOUS STUDIES WERE MAINLY DESIGNED FOR LAB-CONTROLLED FER. REAL-WORLD OCCLUSIONS, VARIANT HEAD POSES AND OTHER ISSUES DEFINITELY INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF FER ON ACCOUNT OF THESE INFORMATION-DEFICIENT REGIONS AND COMPLEX BACKGROUNDS. DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS PURE CNNS BASED METHODS, WE ARGUE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE AND PRACTICAL TO TRANSLATE FACIAL IMAGES INTO SEQUENCES OF VISUAL WORDS AND PERFORM EXPRESSION RECOGNITION FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE THE VISUAL TRANSFORMERS WITH FEATURE FUSION (VTFF) TO TACKLE FER IN THE WILD BY TWO MAIN STEPS. FIRST, WE PROPOSE THE ATTENTIONAL SELECTIVE FUSION (ASF) FOR LEVERAGING DISCRIMINATIVE INFORMATION WITH THE GLOBAL-LOCAL ATTENTION. SECOND, WE PROPOSE TO MODEL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE VISUAL WORDS WITH THE GLOBAL SELF-ATTENTION. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS EVALUATED ON THREE PUBLIC IN-THE-WILD FACIAL EXPRESSION DATASETS (RAF-DB, FERPLUS AND AFFECTNET).

CONCRETELY, WILDFISH++ CONSISTS OF 2,348 FISH CATEGORIES WITH 103,034 IMAGES IN THE WILD, AND 3,817 FISH DESCRIPTIONS WITH 213,858 WORDS. BASED ON THESE DISTINCT CHARACTERISTICS, WE MAINLY INTRODUCE FOUR CHALLENGING RESEARCH TASKS ON WILDFISH++. (1) FINE-GRAINED RECOGNITION WITH COMPARISON TEXTS. WILDFISH++ NATURALLY CONTAINS SUBTLE DIFFERENCE AMONG FISH CATEGORIES, WHICH LEADS TO FINE-GRAINED CLASSIFICATION. MOST APPROACHES RESORT TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM BY CAPTURING DISCRIMINATIVE REGIONS IN THE VIEW OF EACH IMAGE. HOWEVER, THIS PARADIGM MAY BE STILL FAR WAY FROM EXTRACTING THE MOST DISTINCT FEATURES WHEN THE CONTEXT ON VISUAL DIFFERENCE IS NOT AVAILABLE. IN THIS CASE, WE PROPOSE TO INTRODUCE COMPARISON FISH DESCRIPTIONS, A UNIQUE CORPUS THAT CAN DIRECTLY POINT OUT SUBTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIGHLY-CONFUSED SPECIES AND NATURALLY SERVE AS A KIND OF VALUABLE CONTEXT INFORMATION. WITH SUCH TEXTS, WE CREATIVELY ELABORATE A MULTI-MODAL FISH NETWORK, AIMING AT INCORPORATING THOSE COMPARISON TEXTUAL INFORMATION AS PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND CONSEQUENTLY LEVERAGING IT TO GUIDE CNNS TO FIND SUBTLE YET DISTINCT REGIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF COMPARISON TEXTS. (2) OPEN-SET CLASSIFICATION. WE OFTEN CONFRONT WITH UNKNOWN CATEGORIES IN PRACTICE, E.G., THERE MAY STILL EXIST UNKNOWN FISHES IN OUR PLANET. HENCE, WE CREATIVELY ADAPT WILDFISH++ FOR A NOVEL OPEN-SET CLASSIFICATION TASK, WHICH AIMS AT CORRECTLY ASSIGNING EACH TEST IMAGE INTO THE UNKNOWN CLASS OR ONE OF KNOWN CLASSES. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE INVESTIGATE A NUMBER OF PRACTICAL DESIGNS TO BOOST ACCURACY OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS IN OPEN-SET SCENARIOS. (3) CROSS-MODAL RETRIEVAL. WILDFISH++ NOT ONLY CONTAINS DIVERSIFIED FISH IMAGES IN THE WILD BUT ALSO HAS RICH FISH DESCRIPTIONS ABOUT MORPHOLOGY DIAGNOSIS, BIOLOGY INFORMATION, ETC. HENCE, WE DESIGN A CHALLENGING CROSS-MODAL RETRIEVAL TASK, WHICH LEVERAGES THREE SUBTASKS SUCH AS TEXT-TO-TEXT, TEXT-TO-IMAGE, IMAGE-TO-TEXT RETRIEVAL IN A UNIFIED END-TO-END FRAMEWORK. (4) AUTOMATIC FISH CLASSIFICATION. AUTOMATIC FISH CLASSIFICATION IS A LONG-TERM RESEARCH IN MARINE BIOLOGY, WHILE CURRENT STUDIES ARE UNSATISFACTORY DUE TO THE LACK OF LARGE-SCALE DATA. IN THIS CASE, WE TRAIN A NUMBER OF CNNS WITH WILDFISH++, AND USE ITS PRE-TRAINED MODELS TO BOOST FISH CLASSIFICATION ON MOST EXISTING BENCHMARKS OF WILD FISHES.

THE FIRST PART OF THE PAPER DESCRIBES THE USE OF MACHINE VISION AND A NEURAL NETWORK (YOLOV4) IN TRACKING THE PARAMETERS OF TRAFFIC FLOWS ON ROAD SECTIONS IN FRONT OF INTERSECTIONS. THE SECOND PART OF THE PAPER PRESENTS A METHODOLOGY BASED ON THE DYNAMIC REGULATION OF TRAFFIC LIGHTS CYCLES AND THEIR DURATION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CURRENT AND FORECAST PARAMETERS OF THE TRAFFIC FLOW. THE ALGORITHM FOR THE ADAPTIVE ADJUSTMENT OF TRAFFIC LIGHTS REGULATION CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS: THE NUMBER AND DYNAMIC DIMENSIONS OF VEHICLES MOVING TOWARDS THE INTERSECTION; THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES IN THE QUEUE IN FRONT OF THE STOP LINE AND THEIR ACCELERATION AT THE START OF THE MOVEMENT.

A CRITICAL QUESTION REMAINS UNANSWERED: “CAN BACKDOOR ATTACKS SUCCEED USING PHYSICAL OBJECTS AS TRIGGERS, THUS MAKING THEM A CREDIBLE THREAT AGAINST DEEP LEARNING SYSTEMS IN THE REAL WORLD?” WE CONDUCT A DETAILED EMPIRICAL STUDY TO EXPLORE THIS QUESTION FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION, A CRITICAL DEEP LEARNING TASK.

CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) HAVE BEEN RECENTLY USED AS A WORKHORSE FOR EFFECTIVELY GENERATING BUILDING FOOTPRINTS. HOWEVER, TO COMPLETELY EXPLOIT THE PREDICTION POWER OF CNNS, LARGE-SCALE PIXEL-LEVEL ANNOTATIONS ARE REQUIRED. MOST STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS BASED ON CNNS ARE FOCUSED ON THE DESIGN OF NETWORK ARCHITECTURES FOR IMPROVING THE PREDICTIONS OF BUILDING FOOTPRINTS WITH FULL ANNOTATIONS, WHILE FEW WORKS HAVE BEEN DONE ON BUILDING FOOTPRINT SEGMENTATION WITH LIMITED ANNOTATIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL SEMISUPERVISED LEARNING METHOD FOR BUILDING FOOTPRINT SEGMENTATION, WHICH CAN EFFECTIVELY PREDICT BUILDING FOOTPRINTS BASED ON THE NETWORK TRAINED WITH FEW ANNOTATIONS (E.G., ONLY $\TEXT0.0324 KM^2$ OUT OF $\TEXT2.25-KM^2$ AREA IS LABELED). THE PROPOSED METHOD IS BASED ON INVESTIGATING THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE BUILDING AND BACKGROUND PIXELS IN LATENT SPACE AND THE CONSISTENCY OF PREDICTIONS OBTAINED FROM THE CNN MODELS WHEN THE INPUT RS IMAGES ARE PERTURBED. THUS, WE TERM THE PROPOSED SEMISUPERVISED LEARNING FRAMEWORK OF BUILDING FOOTPRINT SEGMENTATION AS PICOCO, WHICH IS BASED ON THE ENFORCEMENT OF PIXELWISE CONTRAST AND CONSISTENCY DURING THE LEARNING PHASE.

THE GLOBAL SKELETON STRUCTURE MODELS THE AIRCRAFT “IMAGES” INTO SKELETON “LINES”, IN WHICH THE MULTIPLE SKELETONS OF THE HOLISTIC AIRCRAFT AND THE PARTS ARE EXPLICITLY EXTRACTED TO SERVE AS THE GEOMETRICAL STRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS FOR LANDMARKS. THEN, THE LOCAL LANDMARK LOCALIZATION PRECISELY DETECTS THE KEY “POINTS” WITH THE GUIDANCE OF SKELETON “LINES”. CONSEQUENTLY, THE PROGRESSIVE STRATEGY OF “EXTRACTING LINES FROM IMAGES, DETECTING POINTS WITH LINES” SIGNIFICANTLY EASES THE LANDMARK DETECTION TASK BY DECOMPOSING THE TASK INTO THE SIMPLER COARSE-TO-FINE SUB-TASKS, THUS FURTHER IMPROVING THE DETECTION PERFORMANCE.

CROWDSOURCED DATASETS ARE PREFERRED METHODS FOR GATHERING DATA ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF BEE POPULATIONS IN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. SUCH IMAGES, HOWEVER, MAY BE PROBLEMATIC TO USE DUE TO LARGE VOLUME OF IMAGES THAT PLACE STRAIN ON THE EXPERTS' CAPABILITIES OF IDENTIFYING THE SPECIES. WE PROPOSE A METHOD TO IDENTIFY REGIONS OF INTEREST IN AN IMAGE CONTAINING A BEE AND TO CORRECTLY CLASSIFY THE SPECIES OF THE BEE. IN ADDITION, THE PROCEDURE WORKS ON LARGE CROWDSOURCED DATASETS (WE WORKED WITH BEESPOTTER) WITH MINIMAL MANUAL ANNOTATION AND DATA AUGMENTATION. OUR APPROACH IS CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING TWO GENUS AND RELATED BEE SPECIES AND RECORDS 91% CORRECT CLASSIFICATION. A LIMITATION OF THE BEESPOTTER DATASET IS LABELING JUST ONE BEE PER IMAGE WHICH MAY CONTAIN TWO OR MORE BEES. WE OVERCOME THIS ISSUE BY CLASSIFYING ALL BEES EVEN IN CASES OF TWO GENUS.

MOST OF THESE SYSTEMS RELY ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS CONTAINING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT A PERSON (I.E., PASSPORTS, ID CARDS, DRIVING LICENSES, AMONGST OTHERS). IN THIS KIND OF APPROACH, THE IDENTIFIABLE DATA IS CONTAINED INSIDE THE EMBEDDED CHIP IN THE ID CARD, AND CAN BE READ REMOTELY BY AN NFC-ENABLED MOBILE DEVICE AND THEN MATCHED WITH A FRONTAL FACE PHOTOGRAPH (SELFIE) OF THE PERSON IN QUESTION. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS METHOD IS LIMITED IN SOUTH-AMERICAN COUNTRIES, SINCE ONLY A FEW OF THEM PROVIDE NATIONAL ID CARDS THAT INCLUDE EMBEDDED CHIPS WITH THE OWNER'S IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. FOR INSTANCE, IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS BRAZIL-WITH A POPULATION OF OVER 210 MILLION PEOPLE-THE NATIONAL ID CARD DOES NOT CONTAIN AN EMBEDDED CHIP. THIS WORK EXPLORES A TWO-STAGE METHOD, USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES, TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ID CARD IMAGE PROVIDED REMOTELY BY THE USER IS REAL, OR TAMPERED IN THE DIGITAL (COMPOSITE) OR NON-DIGITAL DOMAIN (HIGH-QUALITY PRINTED OR DIGITALLY DISPLAYED ON A SCREEN).

AS THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS THAT NEED TO BE OPTIMIZED IN TRADITIONAL METRIC LEARNING ALGORITHMS, THEY MAY SUFFER FROM HIGH COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND OVERFITTING PROBLEMS IN THE CASE OF INSUFFICIENT TRAINING DATA. TO ALLEVIATE THIS, WE PROPOSE A WEAKLY SUPERVISED COMPOSITIONAL METRIC LEARNING (WSCML) METHOD, WHICH UTILIZES A SET OF PREDETERMINED LOCAL DISCRIMINANT METRICS TO LEARN THE OPTIMAL WEIGHT COMBINATION OF THE COMPONENT METRICS.

TO ACHIEVE GOOD COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE ONBOARD UAV AND HUMANS, AN APPROACH TO ACCURATELY RECOGNIZE VARIOUS BODY GESTURES IN THE WILD ENVIRONMENT BY USING DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS IS PRESENTED IN THIS WORK. THE SYSTEM CAN NOT ONLY RECOGNIZE HUMAN RESCUE GESTURES BUT ALSO DETECT PEOPLE, TRACK PEOPLE, AND COUNT THE NUMBER OF HUMANS. A DATASET OF TEN BASIC RESCUE GESTURES (I.E. KICK, PUNCH, SQUAT, STAND, ATTENTION, CANCEL, WALK, SIT, DIRECTION, AND PHONECALL) HAS BEEN CREATED BY A UAV’S CAMERA. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF UAV RESCUE, THE FEEDBACK FROM THE USER IS VERY IMPORTANT. THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT DYNAMIC RESCUE GESTURES ARE THE NOVEL DYNAMIC ATTENTION AND CANCEL WHICH REPRESENT THE SET AND RESET FUNCTIONS RESPECTIVELY. THE SYSTEM SHOWS A WARNING HELP MESSAGE WHEN THE USER IS WAVING TO THE UAV. THE USER CAN ALSO CANCEL THE COMMUNICATION AT ANY TIME BY SHOWING THE DRONE THE BODY RESCUE GESTURE THAT INDICATES THE CANCELLATION ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS.

ITS MANY APPLICATIONS IN DOMAINS SUCH AS NATIONAL SECURITY AND BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS MAKE IT EVEN MORE POPULAR AMONG THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE ASCENDING TREND OF MACHINE LEARNING METHODS. NOWADAYS APPROACHES NECESSARY TO SOLVE REAL LIFE PROBLEMS THROUGH HUMAN ACTIONS RECOGNITION BECAME MORE INTERESTING. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM ARE MAINLY TWO APPROACHES WHEN ATTEMPTING TO BUILD A CLASSIFIER, EITHER USING RGB IMAGES OR SENSOR DATA, OR WHERE POSSIBLE A COMBINATION OF THESE TWO. BOTH METHODS HAVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES AND DOMAINS OF UTILIZATION IN REAL LIFE PROBLEMS, SOLVABLE THROUGH ACTIONS RECOGNITION. USING RGB INPUT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ADOPT A CLASSIFIER ON ALMOST ANY INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT, WHEREAS COMBINING VIDEO WITH SENSOR DATA PROVIDES A HIGHER ACCURACY, ALBEIT AT A HIGHER COST. NEURAL NETWORKS AND ESPECIALLY CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS ARE THE STARTING POINT FOR HUMAN ACTION RECOGNITION. BY THEIR NATURE, THEY CAN RECOGNIZE VERY WELL SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL FEATURES, MAKING THEM IDEAL FOR RGB IMAGES OR SEQUENCES OF RGB IMAGES. IN THE PRESENT PAPER IS PROPOSED THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE BASED ON 2D KERNELS. ITS STRUCTURE, ALONG WITH METRICS MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE, ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES ARE HERE ILLUSTRATED. THIS SOLUTION BASED ON 2D CONVOLUTIONS IS FAST, BUT HAS LOWER PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO OTHER KNOWN SOLUTIONS. THE MAIN PROBLEM WHEN DEALING WITH VIDEOS IS THE CONTEXT EXTRACTION FROM A SEQUENCE OF FRAMES. VIDEO CLASSIFICATION USING 2D CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS IS REALIZED EITHER BY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FRAME OR BY FRAME TO FRAME, APPLYING A PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OVER THE PARTIAL CLASSES TO OBTAIN THE FINAL PREDICTION. TO CLASSIFY ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM ARE SUBTLE, AND CONSISTS OF ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE OVERALL IMAGE IS DIFFICULT. WHEN CLASSIFYING VIA THE KEY FRAMES, THE TOTAL ACCURACY OBTAINED IS AROUND 10%.

NEARLY 150 THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY THE ROAD ACCIDENTS THAT MUST BE MINIMIZED, AND IMPROVING SAFETY IS REQUIRED IN VANET. THE PREDICTION OF TRAFFIC CONGESTIONS PLAYS A MOMENTOUS ROLE IN MINIMIZING ACCIDENTS IN ROADS AND IMPROVING TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT FOR PEOPLE. HOWEVER, THE DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR OF THE VEHICLES IN THE NETWORK DEGRADES THE RENDITION OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS IN PREDICTING THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION ON ROADS. TO OVERCOME THE CONGESTION PROBLEM, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NEW HYBRID BOOSTED LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY ENSEMBLE (BLSTME) AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODEL THAT ENSEMBLE THE POWERFUL FEATURES OF CNN WITH BLSTME TO NEGOTIATE THE DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR OF THE VEHICLE AND TO PREDICT THE CONGESTION IN TRAFFIC EFFECTIVELY ON ROADS. THE CNN EXTRACTS THE FEATURES FROM TRAFFIC IMAGES, AND THE PROPOSED BLSTME TRAINS AND STRENGTHENS THE WEAK CLASSIFIERS FOR THE PREDICTION OF CONGESTION. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS DEVELOPED USING TENSOR FLOW PYTHON LIBRARIES AND ARE TESTED IN REAL TRAFFIC SCENARIO SIMULATED USING SUMO AND OMNET++. THE EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT, AND THE MODEL IS MEASURED WITH THE PERFORMANCE METRICS LIKELY PREDICTION ACCURACY, PRECISION, AND RECALL. THUS, THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULT SHOWS 98% OF ACCURACY, 96% OF PRECISION, AND 94% OF RECALL. THE RESULTS COMPLIES THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL CLOBBERS THE OTHER EXISTING ALGORITHMS BY FURNISHING 10% HIGHER THAN DEEP LEARNING MODELS IN TERMS OF STABILITY AND PERFORMANCE. © 2021 G.

NOTES COMPUT. SCI.,"THIS WORK PROPOSES A NOVEL GENERAL FRAMEWORK, IN THE CONTEXT OF EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (XAI), TO CONSTRUCT EXPLANATIONS FOR THE BEHAVIOUR OF MACHINE LEARNING (ML) MODELS IN TERMS OF MIDDLE-LEVEL FEATURES WHICH REPRESENT PERCEPTUALLY SALIENT INPUT PARTS. ONE CAN ISOLATE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS TO PROVIDE EXPLANATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF XAI: LOW AND MIDDLE-LEVEL EXPLANATIONS. MIDDLE-LEVEL EXPLANATIONS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED FOR ALLEVIATING SOME DEFICIENCIES OF LOW-LEVEL EXPLANATIONS SUCH AS, IN THE CONTEXT OF IMAGE CLASSIFICATION, THE FACT THAT HUMAN USERS ARE LEFT WITH A SIGNIFICANT INTERPRETIVE BURDEN: STARTING FROM LOW-LEVEL EXPLANATIONS, ONE HAS TO IDENTIFY PROPERTIES OF THE OVERALL INPUT THAT ARE PERCEPTUALLY SALIENT FOR THE HUMAN VISUAL SYSTEM. HOWEVER, A GENERAL APPROACH TO CORRECTLY EVALUATE THE ELEMENTS OF MIDDLE-LEVEL EXPLANATIONS WITH RESPECT ML MODEL RESPONSES HAS NEVER BEEN PROPOSED IN THE LITERATURE. WE EXPERIMENTALLY EVALUATE THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO EXPLAIN THE DECISIONS MADE BY AN IMAGENET PRE-TRAINED VGG16 MODEL ON STL-10 IMAGES AND BY A CUSTOMISED MODEL TRAINED ON THE JAFFE DATASET, USING TWO DIFFERENT COMPUTATIONAL DEFINITIONS OF MIDDLE-LEVEL FEATURES AND COMPARE IT WITH TWO DIFFERENT XAI MIDDLE-LEVEL METHODS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR APPROACH CAN BE USED SUCCESSFULLY IN DIFFERENT COMPUTATIONAL DEFINITIONS OF MIDDLE-LEVEL EXPLANATIONS. © 2021, SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG.",NA,MACHINE LEARNING; MIDDLE-LEVEL FEATURES; XAI,NA,"APICELLA, A.; DIPARTIMENTO DI INGEGNERIA ELETTRICA E DELLE TECONOLOGIE DELL’INFORMAZIONE, ITALY; EMAIL: AND.API.UNIV@GMAIL.COM",CONFERENCE PAPER,10.1007/978-3-030-68796-0_14,"DEL BIMBO A., CUCCHIARA R., SCLAROFF S., FARINELLA G.M., MEI T., BERTINI M., ESCALANTE H.J., VEZZANI R.",NA,9783030687953,03029743,LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (INCLUDING SUBSERIES LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LECTURE NOTES IN BIOINFORMATICS),ENGLISH,CITED BY 2,NA,189-203,SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA DEUTSCHLAND GMBH,NA,SCOPUS,A GENERAL APPROACH TO COMPUTE THE RELEVANCE OF MIDDLE-LEVEL INPUT FEATURES,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104338436&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-68796-0_14&partnerID=40&md5=ca55b103ecef8d2807a1be14a668c92a,12663 LNCS,2021,"NA NA NA","DIPARTIMENTO DI INGEGNERIA ELETTRICA E DELLE TECONOLOGIE DELL’INFORMAZIONE, UNIVERSITÀ DEGLI STUDI DI NAPOLI FEDERICO II, NAPLES, ITALY",ISI,0,none,UNIVERSITÀ DEGLI STUDI DI NAPOLI FEDERICO II,UNIVERSITÀ DEGLI STUDI DI NAPOLI FEDERICO II,NA,"APICELLA A, 2021, ","APICELLA A, 2021, "

ELECTRON. IMAGING,"ROAD ACCIDENTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND CAUSE INTENSE FATALITIES. STUDIES BASED ON MANUAL AND/OR SEMIAUTOMATIC METHODS REMAIN UNABLE TO RELIABLY TRACK THE RANDOM BEHAVIOR OF PEDESTRIANS. HENCE, WE FILL THIS GAP BY DEVELOPING AN AUTOMATIC BAYESIAN AND COGNITIVE MODEL (ABC MODEL) FOR PEDESTRIAN BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. WE PROPOSE A FULL AND COMPLETE COMPUTER VISION PROCESS COMPOSED OF TWO IMAGES PROCESSING LEVELS: (I) LOW-LEVEL FOR PEDESTRIAN AND TRAFFIC FEATURES EXTRACTION TO CHARACTERIZE CROSSING THE STREET SCENARIOS. (II) HIGH-LEVEL FOR DATA CORRELATION AND BEHAVIOR RECOGNITION BASED ON BAYESIAN MODEL. SINCE COMPUTER VISION SENSORS ARE USUALLY UNSURE, WE PROPOSE AN INNOVATIVE METRIC TO INTRODUCE THE DETECTION UNCERTAINTY AS BAYESIAN EVIDENCE IN THE BAYESIAN NETWORK DECISION LEVEL. RESULTS HIGHLIGHT COMPUTER VISION TECHNIQUES' POTENTIAL TO COLLECT RANDOM AND RELIABLE ROAD USER'S DATA AT A DEGREE OF AUTOMATION AND ACCURACY THAT CANNOT BE FEASIBLY ACHIEVED BY MANUAL OR SEMIAUTOMATED TECHNIQUES DURING THE FIRST TIME. DURING THE SECOND TIME, THE BAYESIAN NETWORK STRUCTURE PROVIDES VERY RELIABLE DECISIONS THAT CAN MORE COMPLETELY CHARACTERIZE A PERSON'S RANDOM BEHAVIOR. IN ADDITION TO THAT, QUANTIFYING THE UNCERTAINTY OF COMPUTER VISION'S SENSORS AS BAYESIAN EVIDENCE IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION. IN FACT, THE PROPOSED TOOL WILL BE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO DEAL WITH PEDESTRIAN BEHAVIOR. HENCE, THE PROPOSED PROCESS RELIABLY ADDRESSES A PERSON'S BAYES BEHAVIOR AND ILLUSTRATES THE PEDESTRIAN/ENVIRONMENT CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP.

IT CAN BE USED FOR BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPING OF MURINE MODELS OF DIFFERENT DISORDERS. THE USVS ARE USUALLY RECORDED WITH A MICROPHONE SENSITIVE TO ULTRASOUND FREQUENCIES AND THEY ARE ANALYZED BY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE. DIFFERENT CALLS TYPOLOGIES EXIST, AND EACH ULTRASONIC CALL CAN BE MANUALLY CLASSIFIED, BUT THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS HIGHLY TIME-CONSUMING. CONSIDERING THIS FRAMEWORK, IN THIS WORK WE PROPOSED AND EVALUATED A SET OF SUPERVISED LEARNING METHODS FOR AUTOMATIC USVS CLASSIFICATION. THIS COULD REPRESENT A SUSTAINABLE PROCEDURE TO DEEPLY ANALYZE THE ULTRASONIC COMMUNICATION, OTHER THAN A STANDARDIZED ANALYSIS. WE USED MANUALLY BUILT DATASETS OBTAINED BY SEGMENTING THE USVS AUDIO TRACKS ANALYZED WITH THE AVISOFT SOFTWARE, AND THEN BY LABELLING EACH OF THEM INTO 10 REPRESENTATIVE CLASSES. FOR THE AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION TASK, WE DESIGNED A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK THAT WAS TRAINED RECEIVING AS INPUT THE SPECTROGRAM IMAGES ASSOCIATED TO THE SEGMENTED AUDIO FILES. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO TESTED SOME OTHER SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS, SUCH AS SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, RANDOM FOREST AND MULTILAYER PERCEPTRONS, EXPLOITING INFORMATIVE NUMERICAL FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM THE SPECTROGRAMS. THE PERFORMANCE SHOWED HOW CONSIDERING THE WHOLE TIME/FREQUENCY INFORMATION OF THE SPECTROGRAM LEADS TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PERFORMANCE THAN CONSIDERING A SUBSET OF NUMERICAL FEATURES. IN THE AUTHORS’ OPINION, THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS MAY REPRESENT A VALUABLE BENCHMARK FOR FUTURE WORK IN THIS RESEARCH FIELD. COPYRIGHT: © 2021 PREMOLI ET AL.
