## Benchmarking set of papers  

We used a set of 10 manually-located relevant papers from our scoping searches as a benchmark set during search string development. This benchmarking set was used for benchmarking precision of search strings for Scopus database to ensure that most of the relevant can be captured while minimising the number of irrelevant hits.

## Literature search   

We run a search in Scopus on 2021/10/10 using a pre-piloted search string:   

( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ( \*automatic\* OR "machine learning" OR "computer learning" OR "deep learning" OR "neural network\*" OR "random forest\*" OR "convolutional neural" OR "convolutional network\*" OR "learning algorithm\*" OR "Support Vector\*" ) AND ( image* OR camera* OR video* OR vision ) AND ( \*wild\* OR population* OR "species identif\*" OR "species label\*" OR "species richness" OR ( behavio* AND within/ 10 classif* ) OR ( behavio* AND within/ 10 recogn* ) ) AND NOT ( "natural language" OR "sign language" OR accelomet* OR clinical* OR industr* OR agricult* OR farm* OR leaf OR husbandry OR food* OR tissue* OR cell* OR cultur* OR wildfire* OR "tree growth" OR forestry OR hydrolog* OR engineer* OR "oxygen species" OR molec* OR bacteria* OR microb* OR chemi* OR spectrom* OR brain* OR drug* OR patient* OR cancer* OR smoking OR disease OR diabet* OR landsat* OR sentinel OR satellite* OR "land cover" OR "land use" OR "vegetation map\*" OR galax\* OR "Google Earth" OR scan* OR "X-ray" OR "health care" OR participant* OR emotion* OR employee* OR speech OR proceedings ) ) ) AND PUBYEAR > 2016    

We downloaded 2251 bibliographic records for screening. 

The search was updated on to 2022/12/30 to capture all publications from 2021. The search string above was modified by changing PUBYEAR > 2016 to PUBYEAR = 2021. Out of the 751 downloaded records, weremoved all records that have been already screened in the original search and screened remaining 311 records for inclusion. We also considered additional six publications suggested by one of the manuscript reviewer. After screening, we added all extracted records from the search update to the original data set and updated all our analyses.


## Inclusion criteria at the title and abstract screening phase   

Following PICO framework, we included articles if all criteria below were fulfilled: 

- **Population:** wild or semi-wild vertebrate species (exclude domestic or farmed animals, invertebrates, museum specimens).     
- **Intervention** / **Innovation:** use of computer vision machine learning algorithms (include neural-network type methods, such as deep learning, CNN), support vector, random forest) for automated or semi-automated processing of image data (e.g. from camera traps, video tracking, thermal imaging) at a scale where individual animals are visible (include aerial and drone images (exclude images gathered from satellites, biologing, X-ray, MRI images or equivalent *).   

- **Comparator** / **Context**: images taken in the wild or semi-wild (includes zoo enclosures, excludes lab-based or agricultural/aquaculture/pet studies).   

- **Outcomes**: analyses focus on animal / species individual recognition/classification or animal behaviour recognition/classification.   

- Additional criteria: studies published in last 5 years (2017-2021), peer-reviewed (including full-text conference proceedings).   

*Note: Aerial and drone images are used to capture images of medium to large vertebrates, such as birds and ungulates; however, satellite images are only useful for huge mammals such as elephants and whales and require different processing pipelines. Biologging image-based studies attach small cameras to animals to record their movements and activities only and usually require capturing the animals before releasing them back in the wild. X-ray and MRI images are typically used in a laboratory setting or at sub-individual scale and were excluded.  


## Abstract screening procedure and results   
We used Rayyan QCRI software to screen unique bibliographic records downloaded from Scopus. Three researchers (ML, JT, RF) independently performed the screening assessing titles abstracts and keywords of each article. This screening resulted in 225 articles included for full-text assessment and data extraction. Search update brought up additional 42 potentially relevant articles for full-text assessment and data extraction.     

## Inclusion criteria at full-text screening   
- Full text available   
- Full-text studies should fulfill the same criteria as defined for the title and abstract screening phase   

## Full text screening and data extraction   
Out of the 225 papers provisionally included after title and abstract screening, we obtained full-text for 215 papers from the original search. Search update resulted in 41 new articles with full text that were considered for final eligibility and data extraction. One manuscript reviewer suggested 6 additional articles, of which 3 were new and potentially eligible.     

For data extraction we used a two-part custom questionnaire implemented as a Google Form (Table S1). To pilot the form, we randomly selected 14 papers for independent screening and extraction by three researchers (ML, JT, RF). We resolved disagreements by discussion until consensus was reached, and we refined the questionnaire form before the main round of full-text screening and data extraction.    

One researcher (ML) performed full-text screening and data extraction for the remaining 195 papers. Second researcher (RF) cross-checked 58 of these papers for accuracy and to potentially resolve cases where information provided in the papers was unclear. Data extraction update was performed by ML.  

We used GoogleSheet to record data checks and any additional comments. There, we also recorded whether a given paper was used in the pilot rounds, and if it was included or excluded from the final dataset, with a note on the main reason for exclusion.

Each question in the data extraction form (**Table S1**) was followed by a dedicated comment field used to record any additional details, including relevant quotes from the paper. We excluded any papers that were coded as "no" at questions C1 to C6 (full-text screening questions - whether the paper fulfills our inclusion criteria), i.e. these papers were not subject to any further data extraction and analyses.  

After data extraction additional data were added to the GoogleSheet, as follows:   
- Q7_coordinates: latitude and longitude of the study location, as in the paper or from Google Maps, if not reported      
- Q7_location_unclear: 0 = "clear" (location at least at the level of national park, state, province, city, or equivalent - reported in the article or inferred from the data set name); 1 = "unclear", location either not reported or cannot be assigned to a specific location (e.g., global data, broad regions such as Arctic, Northern Atlantic, Africa, America)   
- Pilot: whether study was used in the piloting phase	
- Checked: whether record was cross-checked by an indpendent researcher	   
- Checking_comments: any comments from data extraction checking	  
- Changed:	whether record was changed after cross-checking    
- Changed_comment:	how record was changed after cross-checking   
- Included: whether study was included in the final data set for extraction    
- Exclusion reason: main reason for excluding study from the final data set for extraction, if excluded     
- Journal category: based on the journal title and Scimago Journal & Country Rank (https://www.scimagojr.com/). The following journals were categorised as multidisciplinary: "Scientific Reports", "Science Advances", "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PLoS ONE". The following journals had "ecology" in SUBJECT AREA AND CATEGORY information, or in their title and were thus classified as "ecology": "Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology", "Ethology", "Biology", Global Ecology and Conservation", "Integrative Zoology", "Mammal Study", "Mammalian Biology", "Wildlife Society Bulletin", "Journal of Coastal Research", "Condor", "Methods in Ecology and Evolution", "Environmental Monitoring and Assessment", "Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation", "Ornis Fennica", "Ecology and Evolution", "European Journal of Wildlife Research", "Frontiers in Marine Science", "Conservation Biology", "Animals", "Ecological Informatics". The remaining journals were classified as computer science / technology".

#### Number of species / animal classes used 

Most data sets have prespecified number of animal species / classes present. Class can represent a species or a higher taxonomic group, such as genus, family, order, super-order, etc. (even "animals" can ba a class). Classes of non-animal objects (e.g. humans, vehicles) were not counted. When more than one dataset was used, the number was extracted for the biggest dataset.     

A brief summary statistics on the number of animal species/classes per study.

```{r Species_number summary, eval = TRUE}
#table(rawdata_incl$Species_number == "NA") #13 values of NA = no information in the paper
#table(as.integer(rawdata_incl$Species_number), useNA = "always")

# summarise Species_number column
rawdata_incl %>% 
  filter(Species_number != "NA") %>% 
    mutate(Species_number_NUM = as.numeric(Species_number)) %>% 
    summarise(min = min(as.numeric(Species_number_NUM)),
              max = max(as.numeric(Species_number_NUM)),
              mean = mean(Species_number_NUM),
              sd = sd(Species_number_NUM),
              median = median(Species_number_NUM),
              n = n()
            )
```

#### Table S4
List of papers with > 100 species/animal classes.  

```{r prep Species_number over 100, eval = TRUE}

#Filter studies and select a few relevant columns
rawdata_incl %>% 
  filter(Species_number != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(Species_number_NUM = as.integer(Species_number)) %>% 
  filter(Species_number_NUM > 100) %>% 
  select(c("Author", "Title", "Journal", "Year", "Studied_species_type", "Species_number")) -> 
  rawdata_topspeciesnumbers

**Figure S3**   
Barplot of counts of a country or a larger region where animal images were collected. A single study could be coded as using images from one or more countries/regions. Some studies using images of captive animals kept in zoos likely across mutiple countries were coded as "global" (often images sourced from the Internet/social platforms).

### Bibliometric analyses   

These analyses are based on the information extracted from bibliographic records downloaded from Scopus. Initial preprocessing and summaries using bibliometrix R package. Subsequently this data was combined with manually coded data from the full texts.      
Load and export author affiliation country from bibliographic records (*scopus_AI_1and2.bib*).    

```{r load bib, eval = TRUE}
bib <- convert2df(here("data", "scopus_included_records_2021_updated.bib"), 
                  dbsource = "wos", format = "bibtex") 

# Initial data cleaning and merging with manually coded data frame. 

# Remove all non-alphanumeric, punctuation and extra white spaces in bib object
bib$TI2 <- gsub("[^[:alnum:] ]", "", bib$TI) %>% str_replace_all(.,"[ ]+", " ")

# Remove all non-alphanumeric, punctuation and extra white spaces in rawdata_incl object
rawdata_incl$TI2 <- str_to_upper(gsub("[^[:alnum:] ]", "", rawdata_incl$Title)) %>% 
  str_replace_all(.,"[ ]+", " ")

# Clean-up of 6 non-matching titles before merging - 
# replace title TI2 in bib (not-matching) with TI2 from rawdata_incl

```

**Figure S9**  
A barplot of country assigned to each publication based on the affiliation country of the first author. Co-authorship type is based on country of all authors of a given publication. SCP indicates all authors were affiliated with  the same country. MCP indicates international co-authorship.   

```{r plot first author country collab type, fig.dim = c(8, 6)}
#reshape dataframe into long format:

                                    value, MCP:SCP, factor_key=TRUE)
#reorder by total frequency
CountryCollaboration_long$Country <- factor(CountryCollaboration_ord$Country, levels = levels(reorder(CountryCollaboration_ord$Country, rowSums(CountryCollaboration_ord[-1]))) )
